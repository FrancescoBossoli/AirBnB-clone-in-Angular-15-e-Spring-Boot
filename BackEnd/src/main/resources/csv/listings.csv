87;Luxury villa Lighthouse Croatia;"The mysterious lighthouse is located on the islet of the same name, only 300 m from the west coast of the island of Murter. Its authenticity is proven by the fact that it was built in 1896, and underwent a complete renovation in 2021. It was built to light the way for hardworking sailors and fishermen who find it difficult to navigate at night while entering the Murter archipelago. It bears the title of one of the most beautiful islands, and is only 6 nautical miles from the Kornati National Park. Easy and simple access to the lighthouse is possible, both for adults and children, thanks to the stairs in the harbor. The sea that surrounds it is shallow and warms up quickly during the summer, so swimming will be pleasant and refreshing even after the month of September.

The Luxury Croatia lighthouse is built in a rustic style and is only 5 m away from the Adriatic Sea. It also offers accommodation for a maximum of 8 and optimally 6 people. It is accessible and equipped for older and younger populations who want complete relaxation in a historically modern combination that describes this beautiful location where the lighthouse is located. The lighthouse, on the ground floor, has 3 bedrooms with double beds and 3 en suite bathrooms with showers. If there is a need for an extra bed, you can also use the sofa bed. On the ground floor there is a beautifully decorated kitchen, which is followed by a dining room with a table for 6 people. On the upper floor you will be greeted by a nice living room with a sofa, two armchairs, a table and a TV.

What will surely delight those who like to try new traditional wines, in this case, Dalmatian, is the unique wine stone cellar with 300 bottles of premium wine. Kids will have fun playing Play Station, and swings are available. They will be able to dive into the depths of the sea and explore the marine world.

On the terrace you have at your disposal an outdoor grill on charcoal or wood, the perfect place where you and your family or dear friends will prepare delicious fish dishes and enjoy the magnificent sunsets.";"The lighthouse is open for rent all year round, which is why your stay will be equally perfect in all seasons: spring will be a great time for sport fishing, hot summer ideal for fun swimming in the warm sea, while in autumn you will enjoy romantic sunsets and a starry sky. If you do not come with your own boat, you are also offered with a transfer to the lighthouse, and by prior arrangement you can have a person who will be at your disposal 0/24, a chef and a massager. In addition, you will surely be interested in tours to the Kornati, Hvar or Vis.

The islet of Prišnjak consists of a dry stone wall and a few pine trees, which will create comfort and shade from the summer heat. If you want a luxurious refreshment, on the terrace there is a jacuzzi, 7 sun loungers and an outdoor gazebo for enjoyment and relaxation. Some of the interesting legends of the islet of Prišnjak are that in the 1950s, a pregnant lighthouse keeper's wife contracted premature labor. Her husband put her in a boat and rowed towards Murter. However, the sea was stronger than the rower’s strength and the baby was born in a boat. Legend has it that they named him Jadran, and Prišnjak - Murter was written as his place of birth.

We believe that you will experience a wonderful vacation on this extremely special island, enjoy complete hedonism in peace and quiet, relax reading your favorite readings listening only to the sound of the waves.";https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/miso/Hosting-574543968491208136/original/0de26a38-75f7-4b5f-a20c-78c4e6968f97.jpeg,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/miso/Hosting-574543968491208136/original/d2c5a6d8-eb77-4b06-9eb3-b80fb67070fa.jpeg,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/miso/Hosting-574543968491208136/original/2239074a-5bc7-49a4-88f3-729b5a0eb458.jpeg,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/miso/Hosting-574543968491208136/original/d56eeda5-fe91-49e6-90ee-1e954ef9301d.jpeg,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/miso/Hosting-574543968491208136/original/6d73a552-239d-470f-b472-819ac086996b.jpeg;475;43.826524;15.560660;Otok Prisnjak, Croazia;Entire villa;Entire home/apt;8;3 baths;3;4;2200;3;15;TRUE;Bathtub,Hair dryer,Cleaning products,Shampoo,Conditioner,Body soap,Bidet,Outdoor shower,Hot water,Shower gel,Washer,Free dryer – In unit,Essentials,Hangers,Bed linens,Cotton linens,Extra pillows and blankets,Room-darkening shades,Iron,Drying rack for clothing,Safe,Mosquito net,Clothing storage: dresser,Ethernet connection,HDTV,Record player,Sound system,Game console: PS4,Books and reading material,Crib - available upon request,Pack ’n play/Travel crib,High chair,Baby bath,Outlet covers,Board games,Babysitter recommendations,Central air conditioning,Central heating,Carbon monoxide alarm,Fire extinguisher,First aid kit,Wifi,Dedicated workspace,Kitchen,Refrigerator,Microwave,Cooking basics,Dishes and silverware,Mini fridge,Freezer,Dishwasher,Stainless steel stove,Stainless steel oven,Hot water kettle,Coffee maker,Wine glasses,Toaster,Baking sheet,Blender,Rice maker,Barbecue utensils,Coffee,Dining table,Waterfront,Private beach access – Beachfront,Private patio or balcony,Private backyard – Fully fenced,Fire pit,Outdoor furniture,Outdoor dining area,Private outdoor kitchen,BBQ grill,Beach essentials,Kayak,Boat slip,Free parking on premises,Private pool,Private hot tub,Luggage dropoff allowed,Smoking allowed,Long term stays allowed,Self check-in,Building staff

99;Bird Island : a unique private Island in Belize.;"The original concept of Bird Island was and still is to provide a unique and very affordable place to stay and get to share it with only your friends or family in total privacy (no other guests nor staff is staying at the island during your stay). Bird Island is easy to just lay back and relax, but with the added option of a lot to do if one so desires; adventuring awaits literally right outside your door.

   Important to note that over the years we have added many new amenities to the island in a conscious effort to make it's experience for our guests that much better. The commitment from it's start has been to be an affordable, comfortable off-grid get away with a freedom to do as you please while staying in it. It is not a resort nor pretending to be one. It's price is by far less expensive than a typical resort. There are enough formal, fully catering and by far more expensive resorts available in the world already, so if luxury is your main interest please look elsewhere; but if relaxing, having a great time and being free by not having to put up with strangers is what you are after, you will definitely be coming to the right place as one can surmise from the hundreds of very kind and grateful reviews we have received over the last 7 years.
";"Bird Island is a unique experience; imaging having your very own island to spend time with your loved one, family or group of friends in total comfort and absolute privacy .

121;A High-Alpine Hut in the Mountains;"IMPORTANT: The hut is only accessible by vehicle in summer, and you must have AWD or 4WD. IN WINTER THE HUT IS NOT ACCESSIBLE BY VEHICLE; you snowshoe or ski tour the 3 miles and 1400 vertical feet to the hut on the closed 4x4 trail. (Inquire about our snowcat to haul gear.)

Guests must bring their own sleeping bags and pillowcases. Hut shoes/slippers are also nice to have. The hut is ""self-clean""; leave it as found or better! The $250 cleaning fee will be fully, partially, or not returned dependent on condition of hut upon your departure.

The main living space is 12'x12' and includes three twin beds that double as seating/couches during the day. There is a woodstove for heat. One of the first things to do upon arrival is get a fire going.

The next thing to do is send someone for water at the nearby Spring, creek or by melting snow in the large water pot on the woodstove. In winter, the Spring is about a 5 minute walk up the road, marked by a bamboo at the trail off the right side of the road just after the neighboring driveway on the left. We provide two large 5 gallon jugs for collecting water, and a sled to help carry the load.
