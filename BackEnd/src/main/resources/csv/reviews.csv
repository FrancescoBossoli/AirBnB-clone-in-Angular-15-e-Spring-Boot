2;1;2022-03-20;34;Matteo e suo fratello sono molto attenti, puntuali e disponibili oltre che simpatici. Siamo stati molto bene;10
3;1;2022-03-23;35;Matteo was a very lovely host! We arrived a bit early, but he let us leave our luggage in the loft while we went out to explore Rome. The location is amazing - so close to both a grocery store as well as the colosseum, with a beautiful park in between. Overall, very happy with the experience.;8
4;1;2022-03-24;36;Great place to stay!! Great location near Colesseum, beautiful room, everything was new, super clean and maintained.  Great taste pn design. Matteo was a great host. Price / quality was excellent!;10

6;1;2022-04-01;38;Really great apartment in an awesome area! He was very helpful and flexible with check in/check out. Thanks Matteo!!;10
7;1;2022-04-02;39;Matteo was very friendly and welcomed us at the door. We had to change our arrival time a couple of times, but he was very accommodating. He explained the apartment to us and everything was in perfect condition. The apartment is just as seen on the pictures and its really in a great location. I would stay here again. ;9
8;1;2022-04-02;40;Nice and clean apartment! Matteo was an awesome host :)<br/>;10
9;1;2022-04-05;41;It was two perfect day at Rome on this apartment. Matteo was helpfull and makes these days unforgetable. ;10
10;1;2022-04-06;42;Ho<br/>Soggiornato da Matteo per una notte con alcune amiche. Che dire: il loft è carinissimo! Spazioso e curato nel dettagli! Si trova in una bellissima strada tranquilla a due passi dal Colosseo e dalle vie principali di Monti. Matteo si è dimostrato un'amico per quanto è stato disponibile e cortese! Insomma un meraviglioso soggiorno!!!!!;8
11;1;2022-04-10;43;Clean little loft.  Great location, a few minutes walk from the colosseum, restaurants and metro. Matteo is a friendly host.;10
12;1;2022-04-13;44;The apartment is comfortable and very light for being on the bottom floor. Matteo was incredibly helpful, and made checking in and out very easy. The location is excellent -- easy walking distance to many of Rome's attractions, but quite quiet. ;10
13;1;2022-04-25;45;Matteo was very warm and accommodating. The pictures he posted were very representative of his apartment and we had a great stay.;10
14;1;2022-04-29;46;When we arrived at Matteo's apartment we were greeted personally and then shown around the area, which was only 2 minutes from the colosseum! The apartment was lovely, modern and clean, great for a group of people in such a central location. Matteo was an amazing host who is generous, really friendly and made us feel extremely at home. Definitely recommend for anyone who is looking for a great apartment in central Rome! Thank you :) ;10
15;1;2022-05-05;47;Le logement est conforme à la description. Il manque peut être un peu de lumière mais il est vraiment très bien placé, à 2min du Colisée, le quartier est calme, proche des supermarchés et petits restaurants ! Pour les transports, il y a la station Colisée du métro B et à 10min à pied, la ligne A qui mène directement au Vatican! La fontaine de Trevi est à moins de 30min à pied. Matteo est super sympa, il répond vite et est à votre disposition pendant tout votre séjour ! ;10
16;1;2022-05-10;48;Clean updated and well accommodated apartment a very short from the Colessium, local restaurants, cafes and a beautiful park. Matteo was a fantastic and kind host that met us at the door even though our ride from the airport was delayed. He gave us some tips on where to eat and what to see as well as was available when we had questions.  On our departure he even called a cab for us to get to Termini. We've already recommended this apartment to other people!;9
17;1;2022-05-12;49;Bell'appartamento in una zona fantastica do Roma. Matteo, l'host, molto professionale e gentile. Consigliatissimo!!!;8
18;2;2022-04-22;50;Friendly host, wonderful place. The host put in very nice touch to the place.;10
19;2;2022-04-26;51;A lovely apartment in the center of Rome. Federica is a lovely host, and made us feel welcome. She also left us a guide about Rome, restaurants and all sort of different things, which was very useful. We'll definitely stay here again the next time we're in Rome!;10
20;2;2022-04-28;52;Siamo stati il mio ragazzo e io, era la nostra prima volta a Roma. Federica è stata gentilissima con noi dal primo al ultimo momento. La camera era pulita e tranquilla. Il bagno con stile, carino e pulito. Vicina a Piazza della Republica e Termini, facile di raggiungere a piedi e comoda per muoversi per Roma. Se torniamo a Roma, ripetiremo in questo posto. // Hemos estado mi novio y yo, era nuestra primera vez en Roma. Federica ha sido muy amable con nosotros desde el primer al último momento. La habitación es tranquila y limpia. El baño con estilo, bonito y limpio. Cerca de Plaza de la República y Termini, fácil de llegar a pie y cómoda para moverse por Roma. Si volvemos a Roma, repetiremos en este sitio.;10
21;2;2022-04-29;53;Tutto come da descrizione. Camera facile da raggiungere. Federica è stata un'host gentile e disponibile. Consigliato.;10
22;2;2022-05-03;54;A small cute room close to Republica metro station. The room was suitable for 2 people, nicely and simply decorated and as far as I can tell recently renovated. Its bathroom was clean and well organized. In the room there was a small fridge where we could store our food, bought from a supermarket sound the corner. The bed was really comfortable after a long day, walking around the so many sights of Rome. Federica had left some coupons for us to have breakfast at a shop nearby, a map with the most important sights and some directions. Unfortunately, we didn't have the chance to meet Federica in person but she had given us all the necessary information. I would definitely visit the same house some time in the future.;10
23;2;2022-05-06;55;Frederica was very helpful, especially regarding parking. The apartment was in a great location, with lots of places to eat and quick access to metro and walking distance for sights. The apartment itself was superb and faultless. It's was exceptionally clean and modern, comfy bed and felt like a 4 star hotel! I would definitely come back if visiting Rome again. ;9
24;2;2022-05-08;56;Camera bellissima, prezzo contenuto, zona tranquilla, host gentilissima e disponibile. Consigliatissima!;10
25;2;2022-05-13;57;Great clean room with its own bathroom! The only downside is the wifi connection which was only available in certain parts of the room (near the door). The room is located in a good location. ;10
26;2;2022-05-16;58;Federica was fantastic and we loved this little spot. Our arrival and departure couldn't have been more seemless. Federica provided suggestions to places to eat and even though we didn't go there found it comforting that we had options. We found an amazing little restaurant around the corner that my husband still can't stop talking about <br/>La Locanda di Bacco. Oh also, everything was incredibly clean which was really amazing.;8
27;2;2022-05-27;59;Camera e bagno semplicemente perfetti! ottima la posizione tra il centro e la stazione!   Simpatici e disponibili i padroni di casa...;10
28;2;2022-05-28;60;Todo correcto y ajustado a la descripción. Anfitriones amables.;10
29;3;2022-05-24;61;The reservation was canceled 59 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.;10
30;3;2022-06-01;62;My boyfriend and I stayed in Germana and Andreas's studio for two nights. We received great directions to the apartment and were greeted by Andreas on arrival-he kindly let us use his iron! They were lovely hosts - extremely welcoming. The apartment is perfectly situated in Trastevere, which is quite busy and bustling at night. Thankfully it was perfectly sound proofed! It was clean and spacious and close to all the sights. We would thoroughly recommend this place to anyone visiting Rome.;7
31;3;2022-06-03;63;"The perfect place to stay for a week-end in Rome. Being Italian, I am aware that many accommodations in Rome could reserve bad surprises, but the ""Suite in Rome"" turned out to be a really good one! It is a nice and modern loft, the location is very good, it is in the heart of Trastevere, a few steps away from the bus stop and only 10-15 minutes walking from the most touristic places. Clean, sunny, nicely insulated from the noises of the street, it is provided with everything you need for a short stay in Rome. The bed, a japanese style futon, was incredibly comfortable, the space is not huge but very well organized, we couldn't ask for more! I would give a 10 out of 10 to Germana and his husband and their place, I totally loved it! ";10
32;3;2022-06-05;64;The reservation was canceled 27 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.;8
33;3;2022-06-15;65;The location is great for experiencing rome by foot. You can reach every major attraction within  2,5km. If you're not that good by foot, there are plenty of busses and trams near by. The appartment looks exactly like it does in the pictures;10
34;3;2022-06-18;66;A wonderful appartment on a great location. Just around the corner are some nice restaurants and the major sites (Vatican, Colloseum, Pantheon, Campo dei Fiori, etc.) are approx 30 minutes walking away. Which is a nice way to see Rome. Alternatively, a tram to piazza Venezia stops just around the corner. The appartment is cosey, and makes really good use of the space availabe. Any drawbacks to this appartment? Not really. Just a nice place to stay for a great time in Rome.;10
35;3;2022-06-22;67;Everything was great. Great location, friendly hosts and a great apartment. thank you;9
36;3;2022-07-20;68;Great apartment in a perfect location in Trastervere. Germana was so helpful and book reservations at a restaurant we wanted to go to. Thanks!!!!;10
37;4;2022-07-30;69;Rocco è stato gentilissimo a rispondere rapidamente a tutte le nostre domande. L'appartamento è situato in pieno centro, a pochi minuti dai trasporti e dotato di tutti i confort, dagli asciugamani al frigorifero pieno per la colazione. Consigliato!<br/><br/>Rocco est un super hôte! Il a répondu rapidement à toutes nos questions par mail. Il nous a accueuilli très gentillement. L'appartament est équipé de tout le confort des serviettes de bain au petit-déjeuner<br/>L'appartement est très bien situé, au centre de Rome, à proximité des transports en commun. En un mot, super !;10
38;4;2022-08-07;70;Rocco was helpful and made the check-in process very easy. The apartment is very clean and well maintained, but can get a little noisy outside at night. Great place to stay on our last night in Roma, within walking distance to the train!;10
39;4;2022-08-08;71;L'appartement est très bien situé rt Rocco a été super gentil et avenant! Très bon hôte!;10
40;4;2022-08-10;72;We stayed at Rocco's place our last night in Italy. The location near the train station was very convenient for access to the airport. We had some lovely pizza around the corner, and I wish we'd had more time to explore the Monti neighborhood and nearby Santa Maria Maggiore. <br/><br/>Rocco was extremely accommodating, waiting for us when our train from Venice ran late. ;10
41;4;2022-08-12;73;Rocco was a very nice host. He was even flexible with the check-out time after I slept in accidentally. The location is also a key factor. It's a 10-min walk from the station and the Colosseum is also really close.;10
42;4;2022-08-13;74;Cozy place. Loved the interior and design. Very clean and loved the breakfast and fully stocked fridge!;10
43;4;2022-08-15;75;Rocco was fantastic, we arrived early in the morning and he was so kind enough to let us check in earlier. The place is so central and walking distance to most points of interest, in particular the coleseum. The apartment was clean and a variety of things for the breakfast and snacks. Very generous. Rocco replied to all msgs quickly and was very helpful. Thanks again Rocco, I will definitely stay here again. ;10
44;4;2022-08-19;76;Rocco was a perfect host, really responsive and helpful. The apartment was clean and well located (10 min away from Termini station). I recommend this place !;7
45;4;2022-08-22;77;Rocco was so nice and accommodating! The apartment was very clean and in a great location. Not far from the main train station at all (10 minute walk). He provided us with information we may have needed during our stay, as well as a map of the area. There were snacks and breakfast readily available upon our arrival. Definitely would recommend to anyone wanting to stay in the heart of Rome!;8
46;4;2022-08-24;78;Very tidy and great location! ;10
47;4;2022-09-03;79;Rocco was a wonderful host! Everything we could have needed was provided (including a small breakfast). The apartment was very clean and easy to get to from the train station.;9
48;4;2022-09-17;80;Super séjour à Rome chez Rocco, c'est un hôte très accueillant et prévenant qui a tout fait pour que nous passions un bon séjour chez lui. Le logement est très agréable : tout ce qu'il faut (serviettes, petit dej, savons, micro-onde, plan, indications diverses pour les transports, pharmacie, supermarché..), bien situé dans Rome (10min du Colisée à pied,  15 min du centre historique, proche de la gare). Seul petit bémol, quartier un peu bruyant si on n'est pas habitué à la ville. Mais cela reste une très bonne expérience que je vous recommande !;10
49;4;2022-09-22;81;Appart. Super whel equip, good localisation and very clean. Thank you!;10
50;4;2022-09-26;82;Perfect expérience, perfect location, clean and quiet place im thé middle of Monti.;10
51;5;2022-10-03;83;Patrizio amazing host. The apartment was awesome. Located perfectly. I would definitely stay there again.;10
52;5;2022-10-07;84;Very good location! Nice place to stay 1 or 2 days. The deco of the house is so pretty! ;10
53;5;2022-10-09;85; Patrizio's place is absolutely perfect. We stayed 2 nights and the apartment is incredibly spacious for two people and the balcony overlooking the streets of Rome were an added bonus (even though it is an extremely busy/loud street.) Plus the bed is super comfy!<br/><br/>This is a great spot to stay when exploring Rome and I would highly recommend booking this place for your next trip!;7
54;5;2022-10-18;86;Patrizio was very responsive and helpful! The location was great and the cafe merulana around the corner had delicious lasagna and food. We stayed here with 4 of us girls total and it was wonderful;9
55;5;2022-10-18;87;Muy buena ubicación, a 400 metros del Metro, confortable y cómodo. Patrizio se comportó muy amablemente y estuvo siempre dispuesto a colaborar con nosotros;10
56;5;2022-10-24;88;Patrizio is helpful and friendly. Suite is not far from the main landsmarks;8
57;5;2022-10-25;89;The place is close to everything! You can walk, take the bus or metro. Plus it has an excellent view. The place is very clean, has nice furniture and the kitchen has everything to cook. I went with my family, I have three small kids and it was perfect. Also the host patricio was in time to give me the keys and very friendly. I definitely recommend it!!!;10
58;5;2022-10-27;90;Terrific location. Lovely apartment. Wonderfully soft and comfy bed. Patrizio was such a lovely young man and couldn't have been more courteous and helpful. Try the 'Irish' pub around the corner, had a melt in the mouth steak ....  No more than 25 / 30 Euro by taxi to the main attractions. Bus stop is right outside the front door. Buses can be a problem though as they don't have any stop announcements so you are left guessing or annoying people for help, found it a bit stressful in busy crowds. You are right in the hub of central traffic so there is a lot of street noise but fairly quiet inside the apartment, just a constant hum and occasional siren that can't be avoided... Part of the city ambience. The building is very old and impressive and you have your own balcony which is great and has a terrific outlook. Great little shops for coffee and such on either side of the front door.  Patrizio was able to collect me from the airport and take me to the accommodation for a fee about 15 euro less than the taxi, which was a great relief after a long day travelling.;10
59;5;2022-10-28;91;Patrizo welcomed us upon arrival. The location of the apartment was very central. The apartment was exactly as pictured in the ad. ;10
60;5;2022-10-29;92;Great place! Host was super helpful and friendly! Definitely recommend. ;10
61;5;2022-11-04;93;Ciao , I had an amanzing experience in your house ! Thank you ! <br/>Ciao Ciao;7
62;5;2022-11-11;94;Patrizio was an amazing host! This was my wife and selfs first trip in Europe and I couldn't have found a better place to stay or host. The flat is very centrally located, very close walking distance to Coliseum and metro. I was surprised how easy taking the metro was and it took you right to the high speed trains to tour the rest of Italy. The balcony was amazing and great views, the bed was also super comfortable.  Allot of amazing cafe and restaurants walking distance. I highly recommend. Thanks for an amazing stay Patrizio!!! ;10
63;5;2022-11-14;95;Patrizio is an amazing host with a very unique place to stay !;10
64;5;2022-11-19;96;Staying with Patrizio was amazing. He is a fantastic host with great recommendations  and the place is incredible. Would definitely recommend and stay again. ;9
65;5;2022-11-27;97;Comfortable flat. Close to the Coliseum (about 7 minutes) and the city center. Great host!;10
66;5;2022-11-29;98;Same as my last review!;10
67;6;2022-09-23;99;What a place! This is a large, bright, and clean apartment, newly remodeled, and in the middle of Trastevere (not on a noisy street). The attention to detail was pretty astonishing: Wi-Fi with tablet, flat screen with cable, water in the fridge, etc. Lorenzo is also very nice and accommodating: he kindly helped us order a taxi for the morning late a night. I'd definitely return. Do not hesitate on this place. It's just great, easy, and convenient.;8
68;6;2022-09-24;100;The apartment was very nice and clean, and the staff was really helpful and waited for us over an half of an hour when we were late to check in. Overall I would highly recommend. They even offered a iPad for our use.;10
69;6;2022-09-29;101;We couldn't have wished for a better place to stay in Rome. The location was just perfect, a walking distance to all the sights, yet away from the tourist crowds.  This area of Trastevere was very local and quiet and at the same time just steps away from all the action and very central to Rome's best sightseeing. The apartment was spacious, clean and bright with so many hotel-like details, slippers, toiletries, hair-dryer, nespresso, etc. The apartment is on the 3rd floor with great  window views into the Rome's intimate side streets. Wifi worked fine, the shower was perfectly hot all the time, and a large bed was extremely comfortable to sleep on after long days of sightseeing.  Lorenzo was a phenomenal host, he showed us the things we need to know in the neighborhood and walked us to the store to get a SIM cards for our phones. He was fantastic, and we don't want to stay anywhere else when we are in Rome next time.;7
70;6;2022-10-02;102;Love the area.. LOVED the apartment. It had absolutely everything you could want. The location is fantastic. Lorenzo was an absolute professional. We are already planning our next trip and will definitely stay there again :);10
71;6;2022-10-03;103;Lorenzo met us downstairs, carried up our bags, explained everything and made recommendations for eating etc.  The apartment far exceeded our expectations in terms of cleanliness, homeliness and spaciousness.  The sheets were snow white and crisp, the towels were soft and lovely.  I can't speak highly enough of this wonderful apartment and I'm very sorry it won't be available when we return to Rome in a couple of weeks.  I have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone.  Fantastic value.;9
72;7;2022-02-09;104;Wonderful location! Quiet apartment that’s Walking distance to many great restaurants.;10
73;7;2022-02-17;105;La casa è piccolina, ma accogliente.<br/>Posizione davvero strategica, vicina a tanti bei locali, è stato facile raggiungere tutti gi incantevoli posti di Roma.<br/>Estremamente gentili e disponibili;9
74;7;2022-02-21;106;Great location in a quiet part of Rome. It was as described - 2 floors, a ground floor and the upstairs which hosted the bedroom and bathroom. Our host was communicative and met us at check in. Would definitely stay here again.;10
75;7;2022-02-24;107;Great location, apartment is perfect for a city break. Small but comfortable and has everything you need!;10
76;7;2022-02-27;108;Idéalement situé, parfait pour un weekend en amoureux;10
77;7;2022-03-02;109;The location was great. So many options for eating. A mile to walk to the Colosseum and Vatican City. A good place to sleep. If you are planning on staying in for some nights it’s a little small for that. Very clean spot.;8
78;7;2022-03-10;110;We enjoyed our stay at the apartment. The location in trestevere is fantastic, and the room was perfect for a brief stay in Rome.;10
79;7;2022-03-13;111;Amazing place & host!;7
80;7;2022-03-21;112;wow great little find,perfect location, great Cafe,bar amd amazing restaurant round the corner from here. never done air bnb before amd marina made it so easy, leaving our bags,check in everything. great bar Pimms Carmel restaurant 👌 amust;10
81;7;2022-03-24;113;It was a great location and we enjoyed our time in the city.;10
82;7;2022-03-28;114;Location is awesome and at a walking distance from many sightseeing points and great restaurants. The place is cozy and clean. Recommended!;9
83;7;2022-04-09;115;Very professional, kind & very easy to communicate with. Gave a great pizza restaurant recommendation. We actually ate there 3 times because it was so good, and absolutely the best & most quiet location, especially since it was in Trastevere, and had very easy access with direct access from the street with a bus stops, news stand, and grocery within a few steps from the apartment. Also, was given directions to a pharmacy within a 4 min walk away to get Covid tested before returning back to the US, so very convenient.<br/><br/>I highly recommend staying at this great Rome apartment.;10
84;7;2022-04-11;116;Great location in a lively neighborhood. Had all the essentials. Host was great with communication and helped me when I had questions.;8
85;7;2022-04-15;117;Escalier très abrupte;10
86;7;2022-04-20;118;Faultless apartment in brilliant location. Great communication throughout from the host. Highly recommended.;10
87;7;2022-04-23;119;Marina’s apartment was in a fantastic location in Trastevere - surrounded by plenty of restaurant choices and only a short walk to ruins and other sites. Though in a lively neighborhood, the apartment was quiet and we were not disrupted at night. The apartment is 2 floors - ground and narrow stairs up to ‘first’ floor - with the TV room and kitchenette down below and bedroom/bathroom above. The shower is a stall in the bedroom, a bit narrow and only a few minutes of hot water so plan accordingly with whomever else may want to use it. The bed was large and comfortable. The hosts were very accommodating with our arrival and departure, and arranged a car to take us to the airport. Perfect for a short stay - we stayed there for 3 nights. The disposable slippers are also a nice touch :);7
88;7;2022-05-03;120;Die Wohnung ist mitten im schönen Trastevere ..super zentral und doch sehr ruhig nachts zum Schlafen! Man ist überall bei jeder Sehenswürdigkeit sehr schnell zu Fuß! Die Wohnung war sehr sauber! Die Kommunikation mit Gianni war immer perfekt und sehr schnell und haben jede Unterstützung erhalten und der Taxiservice zum Flughafen ist prima!<br/>Vielen Dank 🙏🏻 und jederzeit gerne wieder;10
89;8;2022-01-06;121;The location of the place is very strategic with very worth it price. Giordano is also very helpful within our stay and with the information regarding the city of Rome.;10
90;8;2022-01-07;122;This place was very spacious and clean, and it was in an amazing location. If we ever return to Rome, we would love to stay here again!;9
91;8;2022-01-08;123;A spacious place and great value in an awesome location. Giordano was a great host. Highly recommended.;10
92;8;2022-01-11;124;Wonderful location. Such a great neighborhood. So much to do everywhere, and very easy to get around. Very spacious studio and great kitchen.;10
93;8;2022-01-13;125;Giodano's place was just as advertised. Right in the center of Ancient Rome!!!! The apartment itself is very spacious and I love the shower. The check in/out process was very smooth and I love the ceilings. This is a great stay for anyone considering getting the Ancient Rome experience.;10
94;8;2022-01-19;126;Firstly let me say that the apartment is quite nice, however there is black mould in the bathroom and a bar in the street downstairs. The overflow for the bar at night is outside , underneath the apartment. It was so loud I ended up calling the police at 1am after repeatedly asking the crowd to keep the noise down. <br/><br/>The bar does takeaway drinks and has rented the space outside the building next door where the apartments are located so it’s unavoidable that the problem will continue. <br/><br/>This was a Monday night so I’d hate to be there on a weekend. <br/><br/>There is also major construction going on next door which is very loud and starts at 6am. <br/><br/>All in all we got about 3 hrs sleep, yelled at a few drunks downstairs to quite down and cancelled the booking. <br/><br/>The host was good  enough to refund for the booking after arguing the point a bit. I had messaged at 12pm , 1am and 3am, to let him know what was going on. He has three rentals here but did not respond later in the night. With the noise from the bar area  downstairs underneath the apartment it’s not suitable for sleeping unless you have earplugs. <br/><br/>We moved the next morning and the process messed up an entire day if our holiday in Rome. Lost our bookings for the day and generally left a bad impression of the integrity of the host. <br/><br/>Not impressed.;10
95;8;2022-01-22;127;Posizione fantastica, self check rapidissimo e ultradiscreto (ferma restando la massima disponibilità dell’host a richiesta..) e ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo! Ci torneremo!👍;7
96;8;2022-01-24;128;The location of this AirBnB is fantastic and Giordano was a great host. The space is functional and perfect for two people. We would absolutely stay here again!;9
97;8;2022-01-29;129;A pretty apartment in such a great neighborhood, we really enjoyed our stay next to many different cafes and restaurants in the old town, and with colosseum right around the corner. The apartment where nicely prepared for us and easy to check in and come & go throughout the stay. Giordano is a fantastic host always available and very helpfull. Will definitely recommend for others who want to experience the beautiful city as well.;10
98;8;2022-02-01;130;We loved our stay in Rome. This apartment was the perfect location. Right by the colosseum, and yummy restaurants all around!<br/>The bed was really comfortable, and the whole room was cozy but also spacious and comfortable!;8
99;8;2022-02-04;131;Absolutely fantastic flat in the centre of Rome, spacious, clean and warm. Giordano is a wonderful host, would definitely recommend staying there.;10
100;8;2022-02-06;132;Un appartement très bien placé !<br/>Très jolie décoration et très fonctionnel.;10
101;8;2022-02-09;133;Great place to stay, perfect location, just a few minutes from the main touristic places, good host.;8
102;8;2022-02-12;134;Be aware this is an apartment in the city and cities have noise.  It was quite loud until 22:00 but after that quieted down nicely.;10
103;8;2022-02-16;135;Die Wohnung ist super schön, groß und ein bequemes Bett. <br/>Und vor allem mitten drin in der City.;7
104;8;2022-02-17;136;Perfect position in Monti;9
105;9;2021-05-08;137;Davvero tutto perfetto: appartamento e zona molto belli, a due passi dal Colosseo. Rocco è super disponibile e gentile, non posso fare altro che consigliarlo!!;9
106;9;2021-05-11;138;Beautiful studio and thank you for all;10
107;9;2021-05-14;139;Fantastic location, quiet building, and attentively run by Rocco.<br/>The only thing missing was windows! However, if you spend all day outside in beautiful Rome, you’ll hardly notice.;10
108;9;2021-05-17;140;Rocco davvero supergentilissimo e sopratutto sempre disponibile..<br/>L'appartamento si trova in una zona comodissima, a 8 minuti circa a piedi dal Colosseo :)<br/>Davvero consigliato!;10
109;9;2021-05-21;141;bello mono locale confortevole tranquillo;10
110;9;2021-05-26;142;L'appartement est parfait pour un couple qui souhaite seulement y dormir : bien placé (15min du Colisée), Rocco est un hôte disponible et attentionné (tout ce qu'il fallait pour nos petit-dejeuners était à disposition). Cependant il faut quand même noté qu'il n'y a pas de fenêtre dans le logement qui est très humide (deshumidificateur sur place) et bruyant (porte de l'immeuble qui claque, voisin qu'on entend comme s'ils étaient avec nous). <br/>Pour autant ce n'était pas dérangeant comme nous n'y sommes resté que 3 nuits et nous y dormions uniquement. <br/>Je recommande le rapport qualité/prix;8
111;9;2021-06-04;143;모든 것이 다 완벽했던 숙소입니다!<br/>위치가 특히 너무 좋았고, 숙소에 없을 게 없었어서 너무 편했어요 1층이라 무거운 캐리어 있어도 문제 없었구요. 주방은 없어요! 전자레인지랑 커피머신은 쓸 수 있습니당 호스트가 이것저것 간식을 많이 챙겨주는 덕분에 주방 따로 필요 없었어요:) 추천합니다!<br/>Thanks Rocco!;10
112;10;2021-01-31;144;Una casa elegante, pulita e accogliente con una vista mozzafiato! Ve lo consiglio vivamente!;10
113;10;2021-02-09;145;Casa molto confortevole, vista bellissima, consigliato;10
114;10;2021-02-16;146;Vista incredibile, appartamento molto spazioso, luminoso e con una vista incredibile.<br/><br/>Avevo anche dimenticato una camicia e l’host è stato gentilissimo e tempestivo nella comunicazione <br/><br/>Consiglio assolutamente;7
115;10;2021-02-21;147;Casa molto carina, check in da remoto che ti permette di arrivare quando vuoi, mancava la carta igienica in bagno. Tutto sommato un’esperienza positiva, location molto suggestiva!;9
116;10;2021-03-08;148;La vista del Cupolone illuminato la notte ripaga del prezzo della casa .... quanto sei bella Roma !!!;8
117;10;2021-03-09;149;Consigliatissimo. Molto pulito, curato, host disponibile e molta privacy. Ottimo servizio.;10
118;10;2021-03-18;150;Appartamento elegante con vista magnifica, spazioso e curato nei dettagli. Consigliato;10
119;10;2021-03-22;151;La casa è bellissima con la vista meravigliosa!;10
120;11;2021-03-03;152;Vania è gentilissima, anche se mai incontrata. La casa è in un posto silenzioso e ben collegato. Peccato che sia un semi-interrato. Per breve tempo è un buon compromesso;10
121;11;2021-03-09;153;Ottimo posto dove soggiornare, rapporto qualità/prezzo buono. Peccato per la camera che non si riscalda al massimo non avendo la porta e la finestra non si chiude;10
122;11;2021-03-12;154;"Host very Ok (after I got to the apartment I understood why she is so kind and prompt) the interest of the host was to rent that apartment, not to be improved.  I was very disappointed by what I found ... the apartment is under the floor with a very ugly iron door that you can hardly close (you break your hands), a sofa in the ""living room"" that was disgusting to sit in the kitchen  everything was glued, in the bathroom the walls were peeled and the window does not close, in the bedroom the window does not close, the handle is broken and you stay with it cracked, the bedroom door is replaced by a white curtain.  !!!!  there are no radiators !!!!  just small radiators that once the room temperature is off are similar to the outside.  I'm not talking about the bed anymore, awful!  Lingerie with a smell of status!  It was still awful !!!!  I do not recommend to anyone!";10
123;11;2021-03-18;155;Alloggio sito al piano interrato, dalle foto sembra carino, ma quando entri la sensazione è un'altre, spazi bui e umidi, riscaldamento con stufette elettriche di fortuna, luce del bagno non funzionante, tamponata con lampada al fondo del bagno. Non c'è ne microonde ne forno elettrico, solo piastre ad induzione. Porte esterne rivestite con nylon, pavimento della cucina sfondato. Ho speso poco, ma allo stesso prezzo ho avuto esperienza sicuramente migliori. Host comunque gentile.;7
124;11;2021-03-20;156;L’ambiente é confortevole e pulito. Molto pulito. La casa è accogliente e ben organizzata. La proprietaria, Vania è come sempre gentile e disponibile. La zona è strategica, è super centrale e ben collegata anche a piedi. Sono venuto a Roma per lavoro ovviamente, ma con tutte queste restrizioni, potersi permettere di essere vicini a tante zone d’interesse è una nota più che positiva. Questo è il mio rifugio romano.;9
125;11;2021-03-21;157;Casa pulita e accogliente. collocata in una zona centralissima ma tranquilla . Ho soggiornato per motivi di lavoro come spesso mi capita a Roma e tornerò in questa casa sicuramente . Che dire poi di vania ? Semplicemente meravigliosa;10
126;11;2021-05-30;158;Appartamento adorabile, posizione centrale e host impeccabile e gentilissima. Se avete bisogno di un alloggio a Roma, vi consiglio caldamente di soggiornare da Vania, non ve ne pentirete!;10
127;11;2021-06-06;159;Vania è una ottima host, ha accolto tutte le mie richieste in modo positivo e ha offerto una location comoda e confortevole.;10
128;12;2022-04-18;160;Un appartement confortable en fond de cour (donc plutôt calme pour sa position géographique : à proximité de la fontaine de Trevi).<br/>Super emplacement pour rayonner vers les quartiers historiques;10
129;12;2022-04-19;161;Great little Airbnb, perfect for a small group. Incredibly well located. Hosts were amazing and went above and beyond to accommodate our needs to drop off our luggage. We loved the character and the cleanliness of the place. Can’t wait to come back again!;7
130;12;2022-04-22;162;Nous avons passé un super séjour à Rome dans l’appartement de Giorgio. Il nous avait communiqué toutes les informations au départ pour faciliter notre arrivée ( emplacement du parking, plan etc…). L’appartement est idéalement situé à quelques mètres de la fontaine de Trevi et à proximité de nombreux centres d’intérêts . Nous reviendrons avec plaisir .;10
131;12;2022-04-26;163;The apartment is very comfortable and clean and the location is great;8
132;12;2022-04-29;164;We enjoyed our stay - the place was in a good location only a 2min walk to the Trevi fountain and in a walkable distance to lots of other attractions. Very clean place and helpful communication dealing with early check-in. It was good find for our 3night stay :);10
133;12;2022-05-02;165;Giorgio’s place was clean and welcoming, nothing was too much trouble and communication was brilliant! We were met and shown to our apartment as Giorgio said we would be, he arranged our Taxi to and from the airport for us and gave us tips on trips and restaurants! Location was fabulous and so quiet considering how close you are to the Trevi Fountain! I would highly recommend it and would stay there again if I’m ever in Rome again - Thank you Giorgio! Xxx;10
134;12;2022-05-04;166;Location was very convenient to popular destinations. It was easy to check in and check out. The apartment was very spacious.;10
135;12;2022-05-05;167;Exceptional stay. Will come back.;9
136;12;2022-05-08;168;Giorgio’s place is amazing, only a few steps from the Trevi fountain. It was nice being able to get up a bit early (or late in the evening) and visit the fountain without the crowds. The apartment is centrally located so its a short walk to most tourist spots in Rome. Giorgio was a great guest and made sure we had everything we needed. I would stay here again if I’m ever back in Rome.;10
137;12;2022-05-11;169;Superb location near Trevi Fountain. Giorgio was very accommodating. Arranged for a driver to meet us upon landing in FCO which was extremely helpful. Great communication before and during our stay.;10
138;12;2022-05-12;170;L’appartamento si trova all’interno di un condominio molto curato. è molto grande e spazioso, adatto anche a due coppie, ben fornito (dalla cucina alla lavatrice) e ben curato!<br/>Senza ombra di dubbi la posizione, a dir poco eccezionale, da una marcia in più. si trova infatti a due passi dalla magnifica Fontana di Trevi e ovviamente è molto ben fornita dai mezzi e dalla vita Romana.;7
139;12;2022-05-16;171;An amazing place for our four day stay! The place is beautiful, spacious, AC was extra nice given the heat, and Thomas and the hosts were incredibly friendly and helpful. Cannot recommend enough!;10
140;12;2022-05-20;172;Absolutely amazing location in the center of Rome, having most of the must sees very close by (walking distance). Perfect communication with the host, quick response times and great suggestions.;8
141;12;2022-05-22;173;Giorgio was extremely helpful before and during our trip to Rome. The location of the apartment was very convenient to alll the sights in Rome.;8
142;13;2022-04-22;174;Absolutely wonderful location and host would 100% stay again !;10
143;13;2022-04-25;175;Excellent location;10
144;13;2022-05-09;176;Great place to stay. Right in the heart of all the cool stuff to see. Perfect little sleepover spot.;10
145;13;2022-05-18;177;Perfect location near Trevi fountain, the room was perfect to couple .. small shower;9
146;13;2022-05-21;178;Giulia was very responsive and helpful both before and during the stay! The location of this property was absolutely perfect! We chose it due to its proximity to major attractions such as the Trevor Fountain, Pantheon, Colosseum, Spanish Steps, and Vatican City. All  were within about 15 minutes walking distance. The flat was clean and despite being next to the Trevi Fountain which was packed with people, it was still very quiet. 10/10 - Would stay again!;10
147;13;2022-05-23;179;If you're looking for a fun place to stay in Rome, this apartment is perfect. You can see Trevi Fountain from the hallway window and hear the crowds below when anything fun or exciting happens. You have great options for food nearby and you can walk to many of the things to see in Rome. We had a wonderful time and would happily stay again.;10
148;13;2022-05-27;180;Perfect place to stay, just in front of the fountain with a lot of shops / restaurants / bar. Super nice !;7
149;13;2022-05-30;181;This Airbnb is an amazing location!;10
150;14;2022-09-06;182;This was the perfect location for our stay and the Airbnb was perfect for us! It was much larger then what we expected and in the central area for everything we explored, thank you!;8
151;14;2022-09-11;183;Lucia was such a lovely host and her apartment was just as amazing. Great location, clean, spacious, and comfortable amenities (for any US travelers, the bed was big and there was an overhead shower head which was great as this was where we stayed coming right off the plane);10
152;14;2022-09-13;184;Fantastic place to stay!;10
153;14;2022-09-22;185;Enjoyed our stay at Lucia's place. It was very clean and met our needs. Loved the shower.  The air conditioner works just fine. Important during the Summer months. The Trevi Fountain is literally out the door to the right. It is a busy place but the apartment is at the back of the building so the tourist noise for the most part is not heard. She does have earplugs by the bed if needed. We ate breakfast there every morning..enjoying the coffee pods left for us and we supplemented it with fresh milk and yoghurt we bought at the market down the street. The location is great...easy walking distance to many sites.  Good restaurants. We did have to take a taxi every now and then and when we found a taxi stand it made it easier to get from one place to another. The Pantheon is within walking distance...took taxis to the Coliseum, to the Borghese Museum and the Vatican. One note is to know that there is no car traffic on the street so if you get a taxi from the airport or the train station you are dropped off around the corner. The apartment is at number 9 and we didn't realize that the numbers on both sides don't correspond.  We looked at the wrong side of the street and thought we had to walk blocks to get to number 9 when it was just round the corner to the right! We called Lucia and she worked hard to help us find our way. With luggage it was a bit challenging but we made it. The elevator is up one story. Just FYI. Everything else worked smoothly . Lucia dropped off clean towels midway through our stay.  She organized a nice driver to pick us up when we headed out to the airport. He came inside and helped us get out luggage to the car. That was very appreciated. We loved Rome. It's a special place and Lucia was a lovely hostess who was quick to respond to any concerns. Thanks Lucia!;9
154;14;2022-09-28;186;Lucia made our entire stay amazing from beginning to end. She offered to book our transportation from the airport, allowed us to drop off our bags before check in, left us champagne as a welcome gift, and was so quick to respond to any question we had throughout our stay. The location is great, right by the Trevi Fountain, so you are in the middle of the action as soon as you check in. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend Lucia’s flat to anyone looking to stay in Rome.;10
155;14;2022-10-02;187;Lucia’s Airbnb was GORGEOUS. The location is unreal and Lucia made check in a breeze. This apartment is in a fantastic area of Rome and we had a blast - absolutely would stay here again on a future visit, we loved it!;10
156;14;2022-10-06;188;Great place and location!;10
157;14;2022-10-10;189;Very nice and well appointed apartment, and the host is kind and communicative.  We were confused and thought the unit had a view of Trevi Fountain, which it does not, but that may be our fault based on our reading of the listing.  Overall a very nice place to stay, and we do recommend it!;10
158;14;2022-10-11;190;I had a great stay!;10
159;14;2022-10-17;191;Excellent host, quick response times, very thoughtful and attentive to every need. Helped coordinate transport from airport. Great location in center of tourist area;10
160;14;2022-10-19;192;Lucia went above and beyond and made Roma the best stay I’ve had abroad . The apartment is right at the trevi fountain above a cute cafe . It was beautiful inside and felt like home . Lucia  even went above and beyond and held our luggage for a few hours after check out so we could visit the Vatican . She didn’t have to do that and I will forever be grateful and always stay w her when I’m in Roma .;8
161;14;2022-10-20;193;Perfect for our 1 night in Rome!  Truly a great hosts that cares about her guests,  we appreciated all of the extra touches and her effort to accommodate our early arrival. Highly recommend!;10
162;14;2022-10-21;194;This apartment is located in a building just by the Trevi fountain. You can see if from the hallway, not from the unit - but the view from the hallway is great and away from the crowd. This is a great place to stay if you want to be close to the sights in this area. This is one of the most accommodating hosts I’ve ever stayed with! Lucia even booked us a taxi driver to get us to the airport early in the morning the day we had to leave. Also, be sure to wake up early in the AM to see the fountain with no crowd! At 5:45 am there was no one there.;10
163;14;2022-10-23;195;We loved our stay! Perfect location and a lovely suite to relax after a day in the bustling area around Trevi Fountain. Thank you Lucia and Daniele for being such fantastic hosts.;7
164;15;2021-11-13;196;Wunderbare Lage, in nächster Nähe zum Stadtzentrum und Bahnhof Termini, aber die unmittelbare Umgebung ist ein schönes, wenig touristisches Viertel. Sehr zu empfehlen.;10
165;15;2021-11-14;197;Nice, clean, well decorated room. Easy walk from the train station and on a quiet street near the important areas.;9
166;15;2021-11-15;198;Host molto disponibile, arredamento moderno e curato;10
167;15;2021-11-18;199;This location is super centric a few minutes from the main attraction , train stations and full of retail store and restaurants . The down part of this is it doesn’t count with a private parking as a stated in the listing and also other reviews are right the apartment cleanliness is questionable the bed sheets were stained and dirty . so seems to me is just a neglect from the host . If you don’t need a parking spot and get a new or clean sheet is a great place;10
168;15;2021-11-19;200;Quick and easy check-in check-out, great price and location;10
169;15;2021-11-25;201;Cute apartment in a great location. Short walk to attractions and close to other means of transportation ( bus, taxi, metro etc). <br/>Host provided us with a picnic basket full of breakfast foods for a quick breakfast on the go which was a nice touch!;10
170;15;2021-11-28;202;Super séjour chez Emanuela. <br/>Le logement est très bien situé, propre et moderne.<br/>Nous avons beaucoup apprécié la et Emanuela est une hote géniale et réactive;8
171;15;2021-12-01;203;dust everywhere, floor uncleaned and unswept, bad smell in the bathroom, kettle dirty from previous guests.;10
172;16;2021-02-22;204;La camera era molto carina e decisamente pulita, il checkin è stato rapido e professionale. L'ambiente era più piccolo di quanto mi aspettassi, ma comunque assolutamente vivibile.<br/>Purtroppo abbiamo avuto un imprevisto familiare e abbiamo dovuto lasciare la stanza prima di dormirci effettivamente, per cui non so come sia l'ambiente la notte, ma comunque ci tornerei!;10
173;16;2021-02-26;205;Appartement très bien situé et au calme. A quelques pas du Colisée. Il est équipé avec tout ce dont vous avez besoin pour passer un bon séjour. De plus le propriétaire est très réactif aux messages et est très arrangeant.<br/>Je recommande !;10
174;16;2021-05-10;206;Perfetto!;10
175;16;2021-05-12;207;Un alloggio carinissimo e molto consigliato, sia per come si presenta, che per la zona, la comodità del letto e la cortesia;7
176;16;2021-06-11;208;Great place, close to the metro and Coliseum, very clean and well maintained;9
177;16;2021-06-20;209;La casa está muy bien. La comunicación fue excelente. La limpieza 10/10. La ubicación también es idonea: está cerca de todo en un lugar sin mucho ruido. La cama cómoda y todo muy bien equipado. Sin duda un 100% recomendable. Muchas gracias por la estancia.;10
178;16;2021-06-25;210;Great appartement near the center of Rome;8
179;16;2021-06-28;211;Grazie mille Néstor!!!!;10
180;17;2022-06-01;212;Nice property in excellent location, close to public transport,  restaurants and Colosseum.  Friendly and helpful hosts.;10
181;17;2022-06-03;213;Amazing and cute loft! Perfect stay;7
182;17;2022-06-08;214;Brilliant place to explore Rome from. The location is unbeatable, everything is easy to walk to. The loft is nicely decorated and felt very comfortable. We used self check-in and the experience was seemless. Communication was fantastic, always had a response within minutes. We'll definitely stay here again next time we visit Rome.;10
183;17;2022-06-10;215;The property is well decorated. However, from the pictures I cannot tell it’s not a loft actually, it’s a commercial property in the street. Which means other than door, you’ll have no windows. When closing the door, you could only use electrical to light up and no way for fresh air to communicate. Another issue is that since it’s the commercial property located on street, it was super noisy. I would say I stayed awake all night. Truly not feel well. Those disadvantages you cannot tell from the description of the Airbnb.;10
184;17;2022-06-11;216;Gian's place is super awesome because it has A/C! This helped us beat the sweltering heat in Rome.;10
185;17;2022-06-13;217;We loved our stay. The location was perfect and the apartment was well appointed.;10
186;17;2022-06-15;218;We were so grateful to stay at Gian Marco’s place! We stayed overnight before catching a flight home. He was so helpful in arranging a driver to take us to the airport. This is a great place to rest your head after long travels!;9
187;18;2022-06-27;219;Suck a horrible experience. Arranged an early check in with Guila for 11am. But upon arriving a gentleman named Luca told us we couldn't get in till 11:30am. So we had to stay outside in the heat with tons of luggage. 11:40 Luca arrived, he told us we could not use the elevator so we had to carry all luggage to 3rd floor with no help. The place had yet to be cleaned. We were told cleaner will come at 12pm. Cleaner arrived at 2:04pm. Did a poor job at cleaning. Its Covid, we had to wipe everything down ourselves. The AC didn't work. It was 100° outside. Guila nor the people that work for her offered any help. Not to mention all the mold in the bathroom. The fridge didn't work either.  I will say it is a great location. But being our first time in Rome this experience left a bad taste for us;10
188;18;2022-07-05;220;Nice place. Good location. Close to all major sights. Our family, 5 persons, enjoyd the appartement. Good aircondition! Good communication with Giulia. We had a great holiday!;8
189;18;2022-07-08;221;Good location and close to attractions. Excellent communication and friendly host.;10
190;18;2022-07-15;222;Such an amazing location, this was perfect for my girlfriends and I.;10
191;18;2022-07-16;223;Good spot to land. Cute and clean with fresh linens and towels. Also has functioning air conditioning in all rooms.;10
192;18;2022-07-19;224;This apartment was well located between Vatican and ancient sites.  Cafe and restaurants outside the doorstep was very handy.  Antonio met us at the cab when we arrived.  Having the transportation booked for us from the airport made landing in a new city very welcoming.<br/>Thank you!;10
193;18;2022-07-24;225;Lovely apartment in a great location. <br/>Very clean and comfortable 👍;9
194;18;2022-07-26;226;The perfect flat in the perfect part of Rome! Our stay was magnificent, would stay here over and over again!!;10
195;19;2022-10-30;227;My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at Santa Nara. We flew into the Fiumicino airport and Emanuela helped organise a private ride from the airport to our Airbnb which was super helpful! Although we were only visiting Rome for two days, we had everything we needed and the room was very clean and cosy. We were also just a very close walking distance from the Colosseum and many other famous Roman landmarks. Emanuela as a lovely hostess and stayed in communication with us! Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Rome. 🥰 thanks again, Emanuela!;10
196;19;2022-11-02;228;This space was perfect for my husband and I for our few days in Rome. The room is spacious and equipped with all necessities, along with a comfy bed and Netflix! The check in process was incredibly detailed and easy to follow and it was very easy to keep in communication with Emanuela. The daily cleaning services were an added bonus!;10
197;19;2022-11-07;229;The bathroom had a really gross smell and the door lock on the bathroom was broken. Other than that, it was really great and perfect location!! Id still recommend though;7
198;19;2022-11-14;230;Chambre bien située proche du centre historique de Rome pratique pour une ou deux nuits.;10
199;19;2022-11-15;231;Espacio cómodo y muy limpio, nos dejo  un desayuno en la recámara;8
200;19;2022-11-22;232;Everything was as described. Walking distance to the colosseum. Great restaurants near by. Emanuela was great!! Quick to respond to text messages. Nice and quiet area.;10
201;20;2021-06-06;233;Ottima soluzione per una coppia od una persona. Appartamento  ordinato, pulito e comodo, soprattutto per la possibilità di recarsi a piedi verso la zona Colosseo/centro e/o ben collegata con i mezzi pubblici;10
202;20;2021-06-07;234;Ideal location, close to Termini. <br/>Clean room, nice aesthetic. The bed was comfortable. Friendly host who communicated clearly. Self check-in with very clear instructions. <br/><br/>There’s a bus stop right when you leave the Airbnb, which is very convenient. <br/>Would recommend for a city trip to Rome!;10
203;20;2021-06-09;235;For this price it was ok;9
204;20;2021-06-10;236;impossibile trovare parcheggio!;10
205;20;2021-06-11;237;Tutto ottimo!;10
206;21;2021-12-22;238;Very nice spot in great location. Balcony is wonderful. The shower is very small and ceilings are low in certain areas.;10
207;21;2022-01-06;239;Loved it here! They were great hosts. I want to move in. What an amazing location.;7
208;21;2022-01-17;240;We had a great stay! The location was great and close to all the major sites around Rome.;8
209;21;2022-01-23;241;We had a great time! The apt. is in an amazing location and the balcony was wonderful. The apartment is on an amazing street, full of shops and cafes, and super close to all of the attractions in the city center. The bed was super comfortable, the building had a lot of charm :) Would def. recommend to friends visiting Rome.;10
210;21;2022-01-28;242;This place is very charming and has excellent location close to the Spanish Steps. We had trouble getting the hot water but rest was all good. Highly recommend.;10
211;21;2022-01-29;243;Location is amazing, and the space itself is great. Beware of the 4th floor walk up, although the stairs are decently wide. The shower can be an issue if you are above 6ft tall as well. I also had an issue with the hot water not really working, but we only stayed one day so it really couldn’t be addressed. Otherwise, this place is beautiful, in a good spot, with a great balcony.;10
212;21;2022-01-31;244;Posto super consigliato al centro di Roma con terrazza! Host sempre disponibile.;9
213;21;2022-02-18;245;Bellissimo appartamento vicino Piazza di Spagna. Casa confortevole e comoda. Dotata dei servizi essenziali. Periodo perfetto primavera-estate per godersi la massimo il terrazzo. Host gentilissimo e sempre disponibile per ogni richiesta.;10

215;21;2022-02-22;247;fantastico;8
216;22;2021-05-09;248;Il soggiorno da Franco è stato molto tranquillo e piacevole. La stanza si trova in una zona attrezzata e comoda, da Pigneto si possono raggiungere le varie metro. Se si ha fortuna si può trovare anche parcheggio gratuito. La notte è stata tranquilla e silenziosa.;10
217;22;2021-05-11;249;Alloggio molto bello e comodo, soprattutto considerando che si trova le cuore del Pigneto. Rapporto qualità prezzo super e proprietario molto gentile e disponibile!;10
218;22;2021-05-16;250;FRanco è stato molto disponibile per tutto. Lìappartamento è una stanza riadattata a monolocale con tutti i servizi necessari. La posizione è ottimale per visitare la città, nel centro del quartiere Pigneto, a due passi dalla stazione metro ma in una strada tranquilla e appartata. Lo consiglio se si viaggia per piacere o per lavoro e si cerca una sistemazione centrale in un quartiere dinamico.;10
219;22;2021-06-04;251;Clean place, lively spot in Roma;9
220;22;2021-06-07;252;Nice place, Franco is very helpful!;10

223;23;2022-03-18;255;Excelente ubicación!! solo a unos cuantos minutos del coliseo y de parada de autobus. Restaurantes riquísimos en la misma calle. El mejor host, super atento, flexible con el check in y check out. Excelente comunicación!! Definitivamente nos estaremos quedando aquí la próxima vez que visitemos Roma!;10
224;23;2022-03-19;256;Great location, quite minimal room.;10
225;23;2022-03-22;257;très bon rapport qualité-prix, très bien placé, petit déjeuner compris, parfait pour un séjour à Rome.;8
226;23;2022-03-29;258;The room is ideally situated near the coliseum. It's a great spot to access some must see (coliseum, Trevi, panthéon, foro romano etc ..) in walking distance.<br/>There's the Carvour metro station at few steps that permits to access Termini station in few minutes.<br/>The street is full of nice bars and restaurants.<br/>the room is comfortable and include a bathroom. Everything is there to make a nice breakfast (electric kettle, a small fridge). and the host is providing coffee, tea, croissants, orange juice... <br/>The host is very kind. we had great communication. <br/>100% recommended!;10
227;23;2022-03-30;259;La struttura è perfetta per chi ha bisogno di un punto di appoggio al centro di Roma. Collocazione impagabile. Rapporto qualità-prezzo eccellente. Accoglienza estremamente cordiale;10
228;23;2022-04-01;260;The place was exactly as advertised, check-in was super easy, and the location can't be beat if you're looking to see the most popular attractions in Rome. Don't hesitate to book!;10
229;23;2022-04-04;261;Super netter Host. Zimmer und Lage sind perfekt, um die Stadt in 3 Tagen zu erkunden;9
230;23;2022-04-07;262;I had a great stay at Le Camere. The location couldn't have been better. close to the Colosseum, a plethora of restaurants and bars, and a 15 minute walk to Termini Station. The host was friendly, provided assistance with easy check-in instructions, and personally helped me with my luggage. The actual room was comfortable and provided me with a peaceful night of rest. Overall was a great stay!;10
231;23;2022-04-10;263;Camera semplice ma dotata di quanto necessario. La posizione è fantastica e il rapporto qualità-prezzo ottimo. Host molto accogliente, ci ha concesso di lasciare i bagagli anche oltre l'orario di check-out.;10
232;23;2022-04-14;264;Great location and lovely staff.;8
233;23;2022-04-19;265;This place was absolutely perfect. Very minimalistic but had just what you needed. Perfect location to some of the major attractions and and felt very safe. Le camere was very nice and also recommended some of his favorite spots in the area. Would definitely stay again;10
234;23;2022-04-22;266;We missed our stay;10
235;24;2021-12-12;267;Perfect location - a lovely little Roman apartment close to the main train station and with all the ancient wonders of Rome on your doorstep. Easy check in and great host in Giordano. Couldn't have asked for me and hope to be back soon!;10
236;24;2021-12-14;268;Un lugar limpio , Excelente ubicación y muy cómodo;9
237;24;2021-12-18;269;Amazing location. Beautiful and spacious apartment with all the amenities you could need.;10
238;24;2021-12-19;270;Beautiful room in a wonderful location!;9
239;24;2022-01-04;271;Appartamento in un ottima posizione per visitare Roma. Super pulito e con tutti i confort. <br/>Grazie ancora. <br/>Ottimo soggiorno;10
240;24;2022-01-26;272;Great apartment right in the middle of a vibrant neighborhood with a super local feel. Comfortable bed. Laundry. Everything you need. We cooked many meals and made sure with a Spartan but sufficient kitchen. Every request was immediately fulfilled though they were few. Giordano is always quick to respond making check in and out a breeze. Looking forward to staying again.;10
241;24;2022-01-31;273;Giordano's apartment is beautiful. Perfect location - right behind the colesseum and within walking distance of everything. Apartment has everything that's needed;10
242;24;2022-02-01;274;Persona molto gentile;7
243;25;2022-07-27;275;The apartment itself was perfectly adequate, with a good location and a great view! It was also clean. Albeit, there were some ants and the fridge didn’t properly seal. The most unfortunate part of this listing was the host herself. She hides the 30 euro cash cleaning fee at the bottom of her listing, which is an obvious and suspicious ploy to bag unsuspecting consumers. In addition, we found out after reading other reviews, that the cleaner is actually her mother! Just seems like a way for Vita and her mother to get a little extra money, tax and Airbnb-fee free. Lastly, she asked us to leave a good review, after having been fully unresponsive when we pressed her on the cleaning fee. The apartment was good, the host was not!;8
244;25;2022-07-28;276;"This apartment was wonderful. The location and the view are absolutely incredible, and those are the greatest qualities here. We were only in town for one night, so this was excellent for us to be in such a central location with gorgeous views from our windows (a true ""wow"" factor). The host was really helpful in coordinating early check-in and a driver from the airport. the cleaning person met us at the building and showed us what we needed to know. Everyone was VERY nice and welcoming, and it really made the final day of a busy trip across Europe a lovely one. Thanks so much!";10
245;25;2022-07-30;277;Perfect location! Everything we had on our bucket list was within walking distance! You absolutely cannot beat the view of the city from the window. The apartment is not very big and the bed is a pull out couch but we had a great sleep and didn’t intend to spend much time in the room when everything is so close. The AC did have a little trouble keeping up but with the weather being as hot as it was it was understandable and she had a fan setup already to move the air around. Vita was kind enough to set up a driver to meet us at the airport and offer us an early check in. Thank you!;10
246;25;2022-08-04;278;This location cannot be beat if you want to be in the center of the historical area. Just minutes walk from the Pantheon, the Colosseum, the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps and a stones throw from the Roman Forum.<br/><br/>The host was great. They were quick to answer any questions that we had and they also provided an extensive list of places to see and eat! I would just add 1 place to eat to the list, Cantina Cantarini. It is about a 30 minute walk from the apartment, but some of the best food we have ever had! A nice place that only locals go to.;9
247;25;2022-08-05;279;Incredible location, breathtaking view, super clean, stocked with everything you need (we were so grateful for the ice cold water in the fridge after a hot day at the colosseum!), and just adorable. Vita, the host, was lovely to work with! Super fast communication, gives her guests a document with all kinds of tips and recommendations, and was incredibly accommodating to our schedule. We were able to check in early at 10am to drop our bags and get to our Colosseum tour on time, which was a lifesaver! Taxis are super close by, and you absolutely cannot beat how convenient this is to the Roman forum and Colosseum. Cannot recommend this place enough! Book it.;10
248;25;2022-08-07;280;loved our stay here! there a little elevator to take you up and the location is PERFECT. the only thing is we stayed in august and even with the ac and fan we were sweating. overall amazing airbnb in Rome and Id recommend to anyone!;10
249;25;2022-08-13;281;Wonderful Airbnb. We would love to stay in this spot again in the future;10
250;26;2022-10-24;282;Great place to stay if youʻve got a flight to catch, good location and excellent food nearby. Very close to coliseum…;8
251;26;2022-10-27;283;Meine Tochter und ich hatten einen schönen Aufenthalt bei Marisa in Rom. Das Zimmer hat alles, was man für ein paar Tage braucht inkl. Badezimmer. Es ist nicht supermodern aber sehr sauber und gemütlich. Das Zimmer ist etwas hellhörig, man hört die Gäste im anderen Zimmer und auf der Straße ist abends immer was los. Bei geschlossenem Fenster sind die Straßengeräusche aber nicht zu hören und uns haben die Geste im anderen Zimmer nicht gestört. Man muss einfach gegenseitig Rücksicht nehmen. <br/>Die Lage des Zimmers ist unschlagbar. Ganz zentral, viele Sehenswürdigkeiten sind zu Fuß zu erreichen und in der Gegend gibt es viele schöne Möglichkeiten essen zu gehen für jeden Geldbeutel.;10
252;26;2022-10-28;284;Location ottima, prezzo buono, ma il bagno non era pulito. Abbiamo apprezzato molto i consigli sul posto, e il check in era facile.;10
253;26;2022-10-29;285;ottima sistemazione in pieno centro storico, arredamento un po' demodé ma funzionale. bagno privato piccolo ma non abbiamo avuto problemi. torneremo;7
254;26;2022-11-03;286;Prime location, great value. A little breakfast and coffee was supplied daily. This airbnb is just around the corner from many fantastic restaurants and just minutes from the Colosseum. It is located just above an outdoor bar, so there is some noise at night, but nothing too bad. We had a great stay here and would definitely stay here again when we come back.;10
255;26;2022-11-05;287;Si volviera a Roma volveria al alojamiento de Marisa sin dudas! me ha encantado! Está muy bien ubicado...cerca de todo! principalmente del coliseo. Está cerca de  una zona con bares donde se come rico y a buen precio!... excelente relación precio calidad ....nos atendió personalmente el esposo de Marisa, el señor Remo, que nos ayudó con todo lo que le preguntamos, nos dió datos del transporte, súper amable y atento. Marisa me respondió los mensajes rápido y solucionó mis inquietudes al instante. El desayuno que incluye es seco pero está muy bien! Fueron muy buenos ya que me dejaron dejar las valijas antes del check in y después del check out sin cobrarme nada extra! Nada de qué quejarme! Estuvo excelente!;9
256;26;2022-11-07;288;camera con bagno privato di piccole dimensioni ma con tutto il necessario per un bel soggiorno.;10
257;26;2022-11-10;289;La habitación es sencilla y muy práctica. Todo lo que necesitas para una breve estancia. No conocimos a Marisa, pero sí al marido, Remo, un encanto de persona. El edificio donde está la habitación tiene muchísima historia que él te contará con lujo de detalles. Estarás a 200 metros del Coliseo y puedes ir andando a prácticamente todas las atracciones turísticas. Sin duda muy recomendable.;10
258;26;2022-11-13;290;La ubicación es espectacular! La habitación estaba súper limpia y era cómoda. Los anfitriones fueron muy amables, muchas gracias!;9
259;26;2022-11-16;291;es una habitación muy antigua, la<br/>Cama es muy incómoda y no tuve agua caliente un día. <br/>Todo lo demás bien, nos llevaron el desayuno los días que estuvimos hospedados.;10
260;26;2022-11-20;292;The room is very well located, 1 minute walking to Colisseum, and many other main sites you can easily can get there by walking tour. Also, plenty  bars and restaurant nearby. The room was very clean, tidy and the attention was good,  the communication for check-in and check-out. I absolutely  would stay here again on my next visit to Rome, many thanks Marisa!;10
261;27;2022-10-29;293;Giorgio’s apartment was in a prime location, we couldn’t have asked for better. Only knock is that it is extremely loud at night but that is something we expected due to the reviews. If you can handle sleeping through a ton of traffic and loud voices then you should definitely book here as the access to all the sites you want to see is unbeatable. Giorgio was very kind and easy to communicate with throughout the stay and was very helpful. Thanks Giorgio!;8
262;27;2022-11-05;294;Emplacement idéal de l’appartement. Giorgio fait le nécessaire pour répondre aux attentes de ses hôtes.;10
263;27;2022-11-11;295;L'emplacement est idéal. Appartement très propre et Giorgio répond très vite aux messages. Je conseille!;10
264;27;2022-11-21;296;We had a great stay right next to the Pantheon, it was a great home base and made it very easy to explore Rome! We enjoyed the pizza and gelato within walking distance and appreciated the umbrellas since it did rain a little during our trip.;9
265;27;2022-11-28;297;Giorgio was absolutely a Super Host! He was very responsive before & during our stay: he provided delightful restaurant recommendations, made check-in super easy, & even came over within 30 minutes (in the rain) to help when we couldn’t figure something out in the apartment.  He was flexible & accommodating on check-in & out.<br/><br/>We found the location to be absolutely perfect - it is easy/moderate walking distance to all the sites we wanted to see. Very charming neighborhood.<br/><br/>The apartment itself was very clean & spacious (other than the shower).  Everything looked recently renovated.<br/><br/>While this was generally a wonderful stay, this is an old apartment building in a historic city, which comes with a few very real drawbacks.  The pedestrian/traffic noise on the street is very loud all through the night & carries into the apartment, which is not at all soundproof. Also, the bathroom had a very unfortunate sewage odor during our stay (maybe due to the rain?).;10
266;27;2022-12-02;298;we had a great stay at giorgio’s airbnb, clean and comfy. Will definitely book again when we come back to Rome, he also responded very quickly upon our arrival;10
267;27;2022-12-10;299;Apartamento perfecto para familia, ubicación inmejorable.;7
268;28;2022-05-20;300;Belsiana St. was a perfect location for our family of 5 including 3 adult children.  The location allowed us to walk everywhere (although we did log about 8 miles on our tour of the Vatican and Garibaldi Park) and there was no shortage of restaurants, cafes ,shopping whatever you need within a few blocks.  Safe area, clean apartment, comfortable bed, clean baths.  Great value.;9
269;28;2022-05-22;301;Everything was perfect from start to finish. The flat is brilliantly located, clean and super comfortable. Mirca was greatly helpful with everything, making sure we were having the best time. <br/>Definitely coming back to beautiful Rome!;10
270;28;2022-05-23;302;This place was absolutely beautiful. The interior was amazing and the location could not be better. Wish we spent more time there! <br/><br/>The owner was super responsive and also helped with transport to the airport!;10
271;28;2022-05-25;303;Merveilleux séjour <br/>Mirca est une excellente hote;8
272;28;2022-05-28;304;Wonderful place, highly to recommend (location, quiet apartment, comfortable beds, great communication);10
273;28;2022-06-02;305;Mirca was a FABULOUS host . I could go on and on about her on this review. From the beginning her communication and attention to detail was outstanding . She not only arranged transport for us from the airport to her place but also helped us arrange transportation when we got off our cruise a week later . She went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. It made a huge difference in my experience.<br/><br/>The apartment has perfect location, so close to everything . We could walk to get lunch , gelato or pastry . Also 4 minutes from Metro and Spanish Steps. It is beautiful and comfortable . <br/><br/>Mirca had friends meet us to help us with luggage and then she herself helped bring them down when we checked out . One morning she even surprised us with pastries ! She truly felt like a friend to us .<br/><br/>Book this apartment !!  You WONT be disappointed.;9
274;28;2022-06-05;306;The location is perfect. Hard to better it. The apartment is huge - twice the size of an average two bed place. Great for families or groups.<br/><br/>We enjoyed the stay and would highly recommend.;10
275;28;2022-06-10;307;This apartment is unbelievable. So large and comfortable and in a perfect location. You can walk to almost all of the big sites and it is close to a metro station if walking isn’t your thing. I feel very lucky to have chosen this property for our stay.  Mirca is an excellent host and I will recommend this place for anyone I know who wants to visit Rome.;9
276;28;2022-06-13;308;I'm not sure we've ever stayed in a more beautiful AirBnB. It was so lovely that we've literally asked if the owners would be interested in selling! The rooms were spacious, the beds and pillows were very comfortable, having an extra 1/2 bath was so helpful with 6 people. The living room was comfortable, the kitchen is a decent size, and it is just truly a beautiful space. We loved our time there and can't wait to rent this flat again!;10
277;28;2022-06-16;309;Beautiful apartment in the best location. Clean,  comfortable, great location. <br/>Mirca helped us with our bags since we arrived quote early. Easy communication. Will be back. Strongly recommend.;10
278;28;2022-06-18;310;Our stay was great! Awesome location, clean and comfortable, excellent communication. I will definitely recommend this to friends!;10
279;28;2022-06-19;311;Great location! Amazing restaurants right outside your door. Mirca was wonderful with setting up transportation from the airport to her place and to the cruise port. The place itself is so roomy and loved it! Would highly recommend!!;10
280;28;2022-06-21;312;Mirca was SO easy to work with!  She answered all of our questions before and during our stay.  The apartment is very spacious and super convenient to be able to walk most places.  She also offered suggestions of where to grocery shop and get good pizza!  We would absolutely stay here again!;10
281;28;2022-06-23;313;We enjoyed our stay at Mircas spacious apartment. We appreciated the extra effort on Mircas part as the washing machine was not working and she took our laundry to have it washed for us which was a huge help on our trip. The apartment was beautiful and convenient. Lovely!;10
282;28;2022-06-24;314;Great place;9
283;29;2022-11-12;315;The apartment was is a great location. Lots of restaurants and shopping and most attractions were walking distance or accessible by metro which was a 1 min walking distance. Giorgio was an excellent host and made getting to the apartment easy.;10
284;29;2022-11-13;316;Such a wonderful experience! <br/><br/>The communication and graciousness of the host was exceptional. <br/><br/>We’d highly recommend this place to anyone!;10
285;29;2022-11-19;317;Amazing place to stay! Giorgio was a perfect host - would visit again!;7
286;29;2022-11-21;318;Fantastically located near a metro station or walk to Trevi, Spanish Steps, and Pantheon. Inside is spacious and great for being a place to rest. A little noisy at night but most apartments on an urban street are. Giorgio was a great host and communicator.;10
287;29;2022-11-22;319;El lugar se encuentra en un lugar muy céntrico, la comunicación con Giorgio fue buena se preocupó desde el inicio.;8
288;29;2022-11-25;320;A really lovely apartment that easily sleeps 4 or 5 adults! A fab location and Giorgio was very helpful! Check in was easy and I’d love to stay here again.;10
289;29;2022-11-29;321;good location with very helpful host.;10
290;29;2022-12-06;322;Lovely location. Giorgio always supports us. I recommend it;9
291;29;2022-12-11;323;Posizione incredibile. Stupenda tra Via Veneto e piazza Bernini. Vicina a molte attrazioni, tipo fontana di Trevi, Quirinale, piazza di Spagna, teatro Sistina e tantissime altre. Appartamento non nuovissimo ma con tutti i comfort, ideale per 4 o 5 persone. Credo ritorneremo.;10
292;30;2022-04-18;324;The apartment has a great location, it's close to a busy street but the windows have good noise protection. There was black mold in the shower but I think you have to be ready to compromise when you get this location for cheap price. I would recommend the place but just keep this in mind.;10
293;30;2022-04-21;325;5min Fußweg vom Colosseum, super gelegen, viele Restaurants und Bars in der Nähe. Restaurant ubbten drunter bedeutet auch dementsprechend Lärm. Einfach aber sauber. 1 Punkt Abzug, Frühstück heisst Nescafé und Fertigcroissant aus der Tüte.;10
294;30;2022-04-22;326;Excellent location, clean and well stocked room. Host was very helpful with directions and recommendations. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a central place to stay.;10
295;30;2022-04-27;327;Beautiful accommodation in the city center. Communication with Marisa was quick and nice. The room was clean. I like it. Thank you for this vacation.;10
296;30;2022-04-29;328;Heel prettige plek. In t centrum. Alles in orde. Aardige mensen. Aanrader. Prijs kwaliteit dik in orde.;9

300;31;2022-11-14;332;Zona davvero molto tranquilla, a un passo dal raccordo e non lontana (quantomeno in auto) dai quartieri più centrali della città. Stanza ben tenuta e divano letto comodo. Il Sig. Giuseppe è gentilissimo e molto disponibile.<br/><br/>Grazie!;10
301;31;2022-11-20;333;Host gentile e disponibile. Casa accogliente e pulita. Siamo molto soddisfatti!;10
302;31;2022-11-21;334;Camera pulita e accogliente. Pur avendo alloggiato per una sola notte, sono stato pienamente soddisfatto dei servizi offerti dalla stanza. Giuseppe è stato un host gentile e disponibile anche agli orari più improbabili e mi ha fornito consigli preziosi riguardo le linee atac utili in diversi orari.<br/>Se dovessi ricapitare in zona, sarei ben lieto di alloggiare nuovamente da lui.;10
303;31;2022-11-27;335;Tutto occhei grazie;7

305;32;2021-09-05;337;Bianca’s place is just soo amazing! I immediately felt like home, like it’s my apartment and I’m living in Rome. Very bright and spacious place with great kitchen equipped with everything you may need. Location is great, 1 minute from Colloseum. Wifi and everything works well! Highly recommend!✨;9
306;32;2021-09-06;338;Tidy and cute place by the Colosseum. Easy to check in and out. Perfect for my one night in Rome!;10
307;32;2021-09-07;339;Well! You go straight to the corner and right in front of you is the coliseum. Next to the building it’s a store where you can find food, drink. And near to the coliseum it’s a restaurant. <br/>Now talking about the apartment, it’s a dream. We don’t even wanted to go out of it. Super big bathroom. Pretty nice living area. Well equipment and beautiful 😻 it has so many details that i felt in love with that I’ll let you discover them by yourself. <br/>Supper recommended Bianca is super kind ✨;10
308;32;2021-09-09;340;Bianca’s apartment was very clean and well set up. Check in was very easy, she was very responsive. Location being so close to the colosseum was nice, and I was able to walk just about everywhere I wanted to go!;8
309;32;2021-09-12;341;Perfect!;10
310;32;2021-09-14;342;Bianca’s place was the perfect place to stay in Rome. Very close to the Coliseum, the Roman Forum, restaurants, cafes train, and many beautiful sites to see. The apartment design was simple elegance and every room was beautifully curated. Each room was plenty big and comfortable! Bianca was very helpful with recommendations and check in and out was a breeze. I highly recommend Bianca’s lovely home.;9
311;33;2022-10-07;343;Raphael was an excellent host. He reached out the day before my arrival to plan the check in time. His flat was clean, modern, and in an excellent location in the heart of the Trestavere neighborhood. When we left he helped us find a taxi to take us to the train station. Raphael went above and beyond, I highly recommend.;10
312;33;2022-10-13;344;Raphael met us and explained the neighbourhood and the apartment.  Clean, well appointed in an interesting neighbourhood.  Friends recommended this listing, I will recommend it also.  When phone issues prevented contacting taxis, Raphael arranged our airport departure - above and beyond.  Any questions were answered promptly.  Very helpful with recommendations and websites.  Thanks Raphael !!;8
313;33;2022-10-19;345;AMAZING!  Raphael’s flat was so suited to our preferences.  Every detail of his flat was meaningful and convenient.  Located in such a wonderful area, it gives a visitor an opportunity to venture in so many directions with little effort.  Communication was prompt and concise and I’d HIGHLY RECOMMEND this flat to anyone visiting Rome.;10
314;33;2022-10-21;346;Great place to stay! Very close to lots of great restaurants;10
315;33;2022-10-23;347;Great host and communication, cute apartment!;10
316;33;2022-10-26;348;Fantastic stay! Raphael was instant with communication and very accommodating of our check in time. The apartment is beautifully clean and comfortable with all amenities could ask for. Trastevere is a lovely part of Rome to stay in and easy to walk to all main sights.;9
317;33;2022-10-31;349;Raphael’s apartment is brilliant and so is he! Perfect location and an amazing apartment. Raphael was so helpful, even popping over himself to fix a door that came off it’s hinges. One of the best Airbnbs we ever stayed at. Also, next door to perhaps the world’s best cheese and delicatessen, Antica Caciara. Will stay here every time we visit Rome in the future. Thanks Raphael.;10
318;33;2022-11-05;350;Great apartment in a great location. Comfortable, safe and convenient. Trastevere is the best place to get a feeling for authentic Rome, and this apartment puts you in the middle of the community.;8
319;34;2022-10-27;351;Amazing location.  Such a great district, full of character, with lots of local cafes and restaurants. So near to the Coliseum, it was perfect. We had a great trip.;10
320;34;2022-10-29;352;This place has it all. Incredible host who goes above and beyond to accommodate anything you need. The place is great with comfy beds, great patio to hangout on and everything you need. Really one of the places for host and place I’ve ever stayed at in an Airbnb.;10
321;34;2022-11-08;353;A great space for a family or for anyone who wants a special Italian experience. The Monti neighborhood is super cool.;7
322;34;2022-11-10;354;El lugar es muy bonito y bien ubicado, siempre hubo gran comunicación y todo se resolvió a tiempo y en forma. Sin duda recomiendo este espacio, la terraza es un gran plus y es muy espaciado. Espero volver pronto!!;9
323;34;2022-11-11;355;Excelente lugar, limpio y bonito. Solo hay que subir muchas muchas escaleras.;10
324;34;2022-11-18;356;Great spot right near the colosseum with lots to do nearby;10
325;35;2022-11-20;357;Ha estado todo muy buen apartamento muy limpio y todo muy cómodo sin contar que está muy cerca de las mayorías de los monumentos principales y se puede ir a pie sin mucho problema, de nuevo muchas gracias Manuel por todo.;9
326;35;2022-11-24;358;we had an excellent stay in Manuel's flat! great location and Manuel was easy to reach at all times and gave great sight seeing tips!;10
327;35;2022-11-26;359;Ottimo e consigliatissimo.<br/>Manuel disponibilissimo, ti fa sentire a casa.<br/>Ovviamente con una scala interna non è per tutti.<br/>Ambiente perfetto, pulito spazioso, molto silenzioso per essere a Roma, le mura molto spesse sicuramente contribuiscono.;10
328;35;2022-11-27;360;Manuel was an amazing host, and made my trip to rome 100x better. Thank you Manuel!;10
329;35;2022-11-28;361;Centrally located, only a 10 minute walk from the Termini station, very clean for an old building, great tasting tap water, and the host was gracious and helpful.<br/>We appreciated his attention and we knew he was always reachable by phone.;10
330;35;2022-11-30;362;Thoroughly enjoyed my stay, close to everything i wanted to see and close to main streets;8
331;35;2022-12-01;363;This is a really nice place to stay, it’s big and has an upstairs with 2 bathrooms which is rare from what I’ve seen. Ground floor, so easy with luggage. It’s not far from the train station. It’s in a busy location so was a bit loud but not so bad. It’s well stocked and there’s a lot of thought put into the details. Manuel was really helpful at check in!;10
332;35;2022-12-04;364;Great place, location is in an alley with not a ton near it though. Although walking distance to major locations;10
333;36;2022-10-11;365;Lovely stay, very easy to get around and Federica was very helpful!;9
334;36;2022-10-14;366;Great clean and minimalist apartment. As you read the reviews, there are 72 steps to get to the apartment. No problem for us but it could be challenging. We also had carry on luggage only. Host was very gracious to let us place our luggage in the apartment earlier so we can start our tour of Rome. Lots of great restaurants near by. A good grocery store for wine and snacks.;10
335;36;2022-10-17;367;Federica was amazing. Swift responses great location and helpful. I left my necklace and they recovered it and sent it back to my in NY. Best hosts ever!;10
336;36;2022-10-20;368;The stay was so good, I think it’s probably perfect place to stay in Rome,  Would love to come back here 6/5 :);7
337;36;2022-10-27;369;Appartement propre et bien équipé . Frederica Maria est un hôte disponible et agréable , elle nous a permis de laisser nos bagages plus tôt que prévu . Appartement bien placé par rapport aux monuments , surtout le Vatican qui est juste à côté . Très jolie terrasse sur le toit avec une vue magnifique sur le toit de La Chapelle Sixtine . On a passé un agréable séjour à Rome ! Je recommande cet appartement .;10
338;36;2022-10-30;370;Bright, clean and spacious apartment in a period block in a great neighbourhood with excellent bus and train links.<br/><br/>Two small supermarkets are very close by, along with great pizzarias, bars and cafes. Also really well placed for the Vatican (a short walk away) and other key attractions.<br/><br/>Federica offered an easy check-in and communicated with us throughout our stay to check if we needed anything. We would happily stay again!;8
339;36;2022-10-31;371;Friendly, responsive host, good apartment ☺️;10
340;36;2022-11-06;372;A great place for a first visit in Rome!;10
341;37;2022-10-19;373;Beautiful place, Nice location, 5/5;9
342;37;2022-10-21;374;Mi sono trovata bene. A due passi dalla stazione Termini per cui comodissima. Stanza pulita e curata nei dettagli. Bagno piccolo ma funzionale.;10
343;37;2022-10-26;375;Great place but there was lack of communication with the host when I needed to ask some things;9
344;37;2022-10-27;376;¡La mejor experiencia!<br/><br/>Maria fue muy atenta, muy gentil, nos apoyó en todo momento y siempre muy respetuosa. Habla español por lo que se le facilitó mucho indicarnos todo con lujo de detalle. lugares para comer, precauciones, lugares, etc.<br/>Chiara estuvo muy atenta desde el primer día que reservé, siempre esta en constante comunicación y siempre al pendiente para dar dar todos los detalles.<br/>El departamento está muy bien, excelente ubicación a 3 min a pie de término, alrededor harmonio restaurantes. Bares, buses.<br/><br/>¡Indudablemente regresaría!;10
345;37;2022-11-02;377;The hosts were very accommodating and the location of the property is great for connectivity to public transport.;10
346;37;2022-11-02;378;Excelente;10
347;37;2022-11-04;379;Cleaning is not bad but the most important problem was bed was so old and uncomfortable;10
348;38;2022-11-13;380;Amazing location. Very sweet, cozy place with all the space we needed.  For a walking city, this place was a perfect location to rest up after a long day.;9
349;38;2022-11-19;381;Ideal for a couple, near everything by walking distance 5 - 20 minutes.;8
350;38;2022-11-22;382;El espacio, la ubicación y cada detalle decorativo es minuciosamente elegido. Todo el apartamento está perfectamente dotado para tener una estancia cómoda y funcional. El proceso de checkin y checkout es sencillo y Stefania responde en el acto las preguntas y las dudas. Nos ayudaron con la limpieza para ingresar más rápido. 10 de 10 a este lugar que nos dejó la mejor impresión de Roma. Volvería sin duda!;10
351;38;2022-11-24;383;The best host i ever had!! The place is beautiful. Totally recommend it.;10
352;38;2022-12-05;384;Bellisimo departamento, con todos los detalles necesarios, espectacular ubicacion en pleno centro historico, salir a la calle y ya estar ahi, con restaurantes a metros. Muy cerca de la Piazza Navona, un lujo. Stefania nos dio instrucciones claras y precisas para el check in, nos ha recibido con atenciones de toda clase, super completo para el desayuno y accesorios. Super atenta en todo, me ha ayudado en un inconveniente personal, estando siempre a disposicion. MUY RECOMENDABLE.;10
353;38;2022-12-09;385;Stefania has a wonderful place, just the right size for the two of us and it has everything you can think of, we even cooked a meal on our last evening And my husband enjoyed the complementary bottle of red wine ( a lovely touch-also all the sweets) , However the apartment is very close some great restaurants if you want to stay near but walking distance if you wanted further out, also walking distance to all the well known attractions, if you didn’t fancy walking there is a taxi rank just around the corner. Absolutely fantastic stay, would definitely stay again 😊;7
354;38;2022-12-11;386;We highly recommend staying at Stefanias place when in Rome. As a host she is going above and beyond to make your stay as comfortable as possible.;10
355;39;2022-11-14;387;I had a lovely and personised stay at the Villa Letizia<br/>Felt very welcomed by the Nuns and found the atmosphere peaceful;9
356;39;2022-11-16;388;excelente, lugar limpio y con buena atención,  la ubicación también me gustó, fue muy tranquila mi noche en este hotel y no me hizo falta nada. aunque no tenía calefacción no me dio frío porque tienen suficientes cobijas;10
357;39;2022-11-17;389;Du wirst sehr nett begrüßt und alles ist topp , Zimmer für den preis auch top , nichts für feine Damen aber für den preis super !;10
358;39;2022-11-17;390;Great stay!;8
359;39;2022-11-18;391;Fue sorpresa que estuviese a cargo de religiosas ya que tengo una hermana al servicio de la iglesia también;10
360;39;2022-11-21;392;Rapporto qualità prezzo conveniente, un po distante dal centro ma comunque sulla via Aurelia. Pulizia e prima colazione tra buono e ottimo;10
361;39;2022-11-23;393;Great place to stay if you want a quiet no fuss night. 30min from Rome city so have to take bus and train to get in. Very Catholic cultured so be prepared if you’re uncomfortable with that. Otherwise good breakfast and lovely hosts;9
362;40;2022-02-04;394;Nagyon szép apartman, minden nagyobb látványosság elérhető gyalog is , nagyon jó helyen van, éttermek , supermarketek pár percre vannak. Az apartman tiszta jól felszerelt. Mire megérkeztünk szépen ki volt takarítva , volt bekészítve ásványvíz, kávé , tea 🙂 a pezsgőfürdő nagyon super van hozzá hangulatvilágítás . Nagyon romantikus igazi római lakás.nekünk nagyon tetszett ha legközelebb Rómában járunk megint ide jövünk , köszönjük ezt a felejthetetlen élményt.🙂;10
363;40;2022-02-13;395;Es genial!;10
364;40;2022-02-16;396;L’appartement est exactement comme sur les photos😍 Il est très bien localisé et permet de faire beaucoup de choses à pied. Je reviendrais sans hésiter !!!;7

368;40;2022-02-25;400;comfortable place in close walking proximity to everything. enjoyed our stay;10
369;41;2022-05-02;401;Sergio's apartment is an excellent stay for anyone spending time in Rome! My girlfriend and I stayed with him for 2 nights and it was a great place to rest after long days of seeing the sights. The room and whole apartment was very clean. In addition, the location is perfect for catching a short bus ride to whatever attraction you want to see or wherever you need to go! <br/><br/>Sergio was an excellent host on top of this. He was super accommodating to us and our ever changing arrival plans. He is very friendly and has tons of info in the form of suggestions and pamphlets on a table in the room for helping to make plans.  <br/><br/>We loved staying here and couldn't recommend it highly enough!;8
370;41;2022-05-04;402;el mejor lugar en el que pude descanzar, todo cerca y muy buena vista excelente;10
371;41;2022-05-06;403;Great stay, very nice quarter, easy to find and the center can even be reached by a nice stroll by the river.;10
372;41;2022-05-10;404;Sergio is absolutely the best Airbnb host we have ever had. (Not exaggerating!!)  He is kind, flexible, accommodating, and great company. He takes great care of you and loves to give great recommendations, especially about food! The room is spacious and perfect for storage and sleeping. It has a great location, close enough to the center of the city to travel, and far enough to get a taste of the local Italian lifestyle. We loved our time here!;10
373;41;2022-05-15;405;Es un lugar perfecto para conocer Roma, está muy próximo al centro de la ciudad donde puedes llegar fácilmente en bus o metro, la comunicación con Sergio fue excelente siempre atento a ayudarnos durante nuestra estancia.;9
374;41;2022-05-16;406;queda muy cerca de varias paradas de autobuses y lugares turísticos;10
375;41;2022-05-20;407;Sergio’s place is as described with the room being very spacious and clean in there. Sergio was very communicative and accessible whenever we needed anything. The metro is also only a 20 minute walk away so the location is also good. The only downfall was perhaps the kitchen, it was dirty and we couldn’t use it straight away after we checked it but it was mangeable if you don’t plan on cooking a lot. Additionally, if you plan on doing alot of clothes washing there is an additional fee that we didn’t know about but it might now be on the listing.;10
376;42;2022-05-25;408;appartement parfait. très bon emplacement, proche du centre de Rome. propre. joliment décoré. hôte très accueillante et reactive. je recommande vivement.;10
377;42;2022-05-28;409;Great place in a good location (and right next to police station so we felt really safe). Host was nice and helpful;8
378;42;2022-05-29;410;you are looking for a place in Rome, do not look any further. Orsetta and her flat are amazing. You are situated in a quiet street in front of the police station. The building is so lovely with amazing features like the grand staircase and old fashion lift, however she completely redesigned the inside and it is modern and well appointed. Immaculate rooms and bathrooms, lovely kitchen for breakfast you can use as well with everything you need. The most amazing thing is that you are about 10 mns from Trevi Fountain, 15 for the collyseum and 10 from Termini Station. She is so so helpful and greeted us at arrival and knew our flight was late! She also took time to explain everything and her efficiency on the Airbnb message app is incredible! She is also incredibly honest as we forgot something in the room and offered to put it in the side or send it back home. Thank you again for your kindness and amazing flat. We will definitely book again next time we are in Rome, kind regards Nadège;10
379;42;2022-06-02;411;Perfect clean apartment with so much room, really good location and really lovely owner will definitely be back!;7
380;42;2022-06-03;412;Orsetta’s place is situated in an amazing location - walking distances from all the main monuments. We only stayed one night but managed to see the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Pantheon, Colosseum - all by foot! <br/>The room itself was big and spacious and situated on a quiet and peaceful street so we had no issues with falling asleep. <br/>Orsetta was also extremely accomodating and responsive.;9
381;42;2022-06-07;413;Very quiet and clean , really central located appartement.<br/>Very good communication with Orsetta who shares good restaurant recommendations. Nice spot to stay for different days! We visited everything on foot from the appartement;10

387;43;2022-11-01;419;Cumplió con creces nuestras expectativas, el lugar esta muy bien ubicado, a 10 min caminando del terminal y 10 min caminando del coliseo, el recinto es seguro, la habitación limpia, internet rápido y la comunicación con anfitrion fluida. Fueron muy amables al ajustar el chek-in.;10

389;43;2022-11-06;421;Hotel in buona posizione, a metà tra Colosseo e stazione Termini, molto pulito e camera spaziosa per due persone. Peccato solo per il bagno che ogni tanto tirando lo sciacquone schizzava acqua dal serbatoio. <br/>Accoglienza gentilissima e disponibile, ottima comunicazione con il gestore.;10
390;43;2022-11-19;422;cazarea se afla la 15 minute mers pe jos de Colosseum. <br/>Recomand si restaurantul de vis-a-vis de hotel.<br/>camera micuta, dar curata.;8

394;44;2022-10-16;426;Daniele è gentilissimo è super flessibile su orari e modalità di check in! L’appartamento non è in una posizione centrale ma strategico per collegarsi a tutto con i mezzi. 10-15min a piedi da piazza san Pietro. Appartamento pulitissimo, comodo e funzionalmente ben arredato. Torneremo sicuramente!;10
395;44;2022-10-21;427;I cannot recommend this apartment enough! It is perfect for solo travellers or couples. The apartment was impeccably clean. It is in such a great location: close to both thebus and metro, but also within walking distance of all of the main sites.<br/>When we arrived we were welcomed like old friends and truly felt like we were appreciated by the host as guests in her home.<br/>Will 100% be booking when we visit Rome again. 5 stars;10

400;44;2022-11-08;432;We had a great day-- the apartment was clean and self check-in was a breeze. Daniele was excellent with communication and even helped a set of a taxi from the airport. One convenient bus to the Vatican City, or a quick transfer to the Colliseum.  Would definitely stay there again.;9
