3;1;2022-03-23;35;Francesco was a very lovely host! We arrived a bit early, but he let us leave our luggage in the loft while we went out to explore Rome. The location is amazing - so close to both a grocery store as well as the colosseum, with a beautiful park in between. Overall, very happy with the experience.;8

7;1;2022-04-02;39;Francesco was very friendly and welcomed us at the door. We had to change our arrival time a couple of times, but he was very accommodating.

10;1;2022-04-06;42;Ho Soggiornato da Francesco per una notte con alcune amiche. Che dire: il loft è carinissimo! Spazioso e curato nel dettagli! Si trova in una bellissima strada tranquilla a due passi dal Colosseo e dalle vie principali di Monti. Francesco si è dimostrato un'amico per quanto è stato disponibile e cortese! Insomma un meraviglioso soggiorno!!!!!;8
11;1;2022-04-10;43;Clean little loft. Great location, a few minutes walk from the colosseum, restaurants and metro. Francesco is a friendly host.;10
12;1;2022-04-13;44;The apartment is comfortable and very light for being on the bottom floor. Francesco was incredibly helpful, and made checking in and out very easy. The location is excellent -- easy walking distance to many of Rome's attractions, but quite quiet. ;10
13;1;2022-04-25;45;Francesco was very warm and accommodating. The pictures he posted were very representative of his apartment and we had a great stay.;10
14;1;2022-04-29;46;When we arrived at Francesco's apartment we were greeted personally and then shown around the area, which was only 2 minutes from the colosseum! The apartment was lovely, modern and clean, great for a group of people in such a central location. Francesco was an amazing host who is generous, really friendly and made us feel extremely at home. Definitely recommend for anyone who is looking for a great apartment in central Rome! Thank you :) ;10
15;1;2022-05-05;47;Le logement est conforme à la description. Il manque peut être un peu de lumière mais il est vraiment très bien placé, à 2min du Colisée, le quartier est calme, proche des supermarchés et petits restaurants ! Pour les transports, il y a la station Colisée du métro B et à 10min à pied, la ligne A qui mène directement au Vatican! La fontaine de Trevi est à moins de 30min à pied. Francesco est super sympa, il répond vite et est à votre disposition pendant tout votre séjour ! ;10
16;1;2022-05-10;48;Clean updated and well accommodated apartment a very short from the Colessium, local restaurants, cafes and a beautiful park. Francesco was a fantastic and kind host that met us at the door even though our ride from the airport was delayed. He gave us some tips on where to eat and what to see as well as was available when we had questions. On our departure he even called a cab for us to get to Termini. We've already recommended this apartment to other people!;9
17;1;2022-05-12;49;Bell'appartamento in una zona fantastica do Roma. Francesco, l'host, molto professionale e gentile. Consigliatissimo!!!;8
18;2;2022-04-22;50;Friendly host, wonderful place. The host put in very nice touch to the place.;10
19;2;2022-04-26;51;A lovely apartment in the center of Rome. Federica is a lovely host, and made us feel welcome. She also left us a guide about Rome, restaurants and all sort of different things, which was very useful. We'll definitely stay here again the next time we're in Rome!;10
20;2;2022-04-28;52;Siamo stati il mio ragazzo e io, era la nostra prima volta a Roma. Federica è stata gentilissima con noi dal primo al ultimo momento. La camera era pulita e tranquilla. Il bagno con stile, carino e pulito. Vicina a Piazza della Republica e Termini, facile di raggiungere a piedi e comoda per muoversi per Roma. Se torniamo a Roma, ripetiremo in questo posto. // Hemos estado mi novio y yo, era nuestra primera vez en Roma. Federica ha sido muy amable con nosotros desde el primer al último momento. La habitación es tranquila y limpia. El baño con estilo, bonito y limpio. Cerca de Plaza de la República y Termini, fácil de llegar a pie y cómoda para moverse por Roma. Si volvemos a Roma, repetiremos en este sitio.;10
21;2;2022-04-29;53;Tutto come da descrizione. Camera facile da raggiungere. Federica è stata un'host gentile e disponibile. Consigliato.;10
22;2;2022-05-03;54;A small cute room close to Republica metro station. The room was suitable for 2 people, nicely and simply decorated and as far as I can tell recently renovated. Its bathroom was clean and well organized. In the room there was a small fridge where we could store our food, bought from a supermarket sound the corner. The bed was really comfortable after a long day, walking around the so many sights of Rome. Federica had left some coupons for us to have breakfast at a shop nearby, a map with the most important sights and some directions. Unfortunately, we didn't have the chance to meet Federica in person but she had given us all the necessary information. I would definitely visit the same house some time in the future.;10
23;2;2022-05-06;55;Frederica was very helpful, especially regarding parking. The apartment was in a great location, with lots of places to eat and quick access to metro and walking distance for sights. The apartment itself was superb and faultless. It's was exceptionally clean and modern, comfy bed and felt like a 4 star hotel! I would definitely come back if visiting Rome again. ;9
24;2;2022-05-08;56;Camera bellissima, prezzo contenuto, zona tranquilla, host gentilissima e disponibile. Consigliatissima!;10
25;2;2022-05-13;57;Great clean room with its own bathroom! The only downside is the wifi connection which was only available in certain parts of the room (near the door). The room is located in a good location. ;10
26;2;2022-05-16;58;Federica was fantastic and we loved this little spot. Our arrival and departure couldn't have been more seemless. Federica provided suggestions to places to eat and even though we didn't go there found it comforting that we had options. We found an amazing little restaurant around the corner that my husband still can't stop talking about La Locanda di Bacco. Oh also, everything was incredibly clean which was really amazing.;8
27;2;2022-05-27;59;Camera e bagno semplicemente perfetti! ottima la posizione tra il centro e la stazione! Simpatici e disponibili i padroni di casa...;10
28;2;2022-05-28;60;Todo correcto y ajustado a la descripción. Anfitriones amables.;10
29;3;2022-05-24;61;The reservation was canceled 59 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.;7
30;3;2022-06-01;62;My boyfriend and I stayed in Germana and Andreas's studio for two nights. We received great directions to the apartment and were greeted by Andreas on arrival-he kindly let us use his iron! They were lovely hosts - extremely welcoming. The apartment is perfectly situated in Trastevere, which is quite busy and bustling at night. Thankfully it was perfectly sound proofed! It was clean and spacious and close to all the sights. We would thoroughly recommend this place to anyone visiting Rome.;7
31;3;2022-06-03;63;"The perfect place to stay for a week-end in Rome. Being Italian, I am aware that many accommodations in Rome could reserve bad surprises, but the ""Suite in Rome"" turned out to be a really good one! It is a nice and modern loft, the location is very good, it is in the heart of Trastevere, a few steps away from the bus stop and only 10-15 minutes walking from the most touristic places. Clean, sunny, nicely insulated from the noises of the street, it is provided with everything you need for a short stay in Rome. The bed, a japanese style futon, was incredibly comfortable, the space is not huge but very well organized, we couldn't ask for more! I would give a 10 out of 10 to Germana and his husband and their place, I totally loved it! ";10
32;3;2022-06-05;64;The reservation was canceled 27 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.;6
33;3;2022-06-15;65;The location is great for experiencing rome by foot. You can reach every major attraction within 2,5km. If you're not that good by foot, there are plenty of busses and trams near by. The appartment looks exactly like it does in the pictures;10
34;3;2022-06-18;66;A wonderful appartment on a great location. Just around the corner are some nice restaurants and the major sites (Vatican, Colloseum, Pantheon, Campo dei Fiori, etc.) are approx 30 minutes walking away. Which is a nice way to see Rome. Alternatively, a tram to piazza Venezia stops just around the corner. The appartment is cosey, and makes really good use of the space availabe. Any drawbacks to this appartment? Not really. Just a nice place to stay for a great time in Rome.;10
35;3;2022-06-22;67;Everything was great. Great location, friendly hosts and a great apartment. thank you;9
36;3;2022-07-20;68;Great apartment in a perfect location in Trastervere. Germana was so helpful and book reservations at a restaurant we wanted to go to. Thanks!!!!;10
37;4;2022-07-30;69;Rocco è stato gentilissimo a rispondere rapidamente a tutte le nostre domande. L'appartamento è situato in pieno centro, a pochi minuti dai trasporti e dotato di tutti i confort, dagli asciugamani al frigorifero pieno per la colazione. Consigliato! Rocco est un super hôte! Il a répondu rapidement à toutes nos questions par mail. Il nous a accueuilli très gentillement. L'appartament est équipé de tout le confort des serviettes de bain au petit-déjeuner L'appartement est très bien situé, au centre de Rome, à proximité des transports en commun. En un mot, super !;10
38;4;2022-08-07;70;Rocco was helpful and made the check-in process very easy. The apartment is very clean and well maintained, but can get a little noisy outside at night. Great place to stay on our last night in Roma, within walking distance to the train!;10
39;4;2022-08-08;71;L'appartement est très bien situé rt Rocco a été super gentil et avenant! Très bon hôte!;10
40;4;2022-08-10;72;We stayed at Rocco's place our last night in Italy. The location near the train station was very convenient for access to the airport. We had some lovely pizza around the corner, and I wish we'd had more time to explore the Monti neighborhood and nearby Santa Maria Maggiore. Rocco was extremely accommodating, waiting for us when our train from Venice ran late. ;10
41;4;2022-08-12;73;Rocco was a very nice host. He was even flexible with the check-out time after I slept in accidentally. The location is also a key factor. It's a 10-min walk from the station and the Colosseum is also really close.;10
42;4;2022-08-13;74;Cozy place. Loved the interior and design. Very clean and loved the breakfast and fully stocked fridge!;10
43;4;2022-08-15;75;Rocco was fantastic, we arrived early in the morning and he was so kind enough to let us check in earlier. The place is so central and walking distance to most points of interest, in particular the coleseum. The apartment was clean and a variety of things for the breakfast and snacks. Very generous. Rocco replied to all msgs quickly and was very helpful. Thanks again Rocco, I will definitely stay here again. ;10
44;4;2022-08-19;76;Rocco was a perfect host, really responsive and helpful. The apartment was clean and well located (10 min away from Termini station). I recommend this place !;7
45;4;2022-08-22;77;Rocco was so nice and accommodating! The apartment was very clean and in a great location. Not far from the main train station at all (10 minute walk). He provided us with information we may have needed during our stay, as well as a map of the area. There were snacks and breakfast readily available upon our arrival. Definitely would recommend to anyone wanting to stay in the heart of Rome!;8
46;4;2022-08-24;78;Very tidy and great location! ;10
47;4;2022-09-03;79;Rocco was a wonderful host! Everything we could have needed was provided (including a small breakfast). The apartment was very clean and easy to get to from the train station.;9
48;4;2022-09-17;80;Super séjour à Rome chez Rocco, c'est un hôte très accueillant et prévenant qui a tout fait pour que nous passions un bon séjour chez lui. Le logement est très agréable : tout ce qu'il faut (serviettes, petit dej, savons, micro-onde, plan, indications diverses pour les transports, pharmacie, supermarché..), bien situé dans Rome (10min du Colisée à pied, 15 min du centre historique, proche de la gare). Seul petit bémol, quartier un peu bruyant si on n'est pas habitué à la ville. Mais cela reste une très bonne expérience que je vous recommande !;10
49;4;2022-09-22;81;Appart. Super whel equip, good localisation and very clean. Thank you!;10
50;4;2022-09-26;82;Perfect expérience, perfect location, clean and quiet place im thé middle of Monti.;10
51;5;2022-10-03;83;Patrizio amazing host. The apartment was awesome. Located perfectly. I would definitely stay there again.;10
52;5;2022-10-07;84;Very good location! Nice place to stay 1 or 2 days. The deco of the house is so pretty! ;10
53;5;2022-10-09;85; Patrizio's place is absolutely perfect. We stayed 2 nights and the apartment is incredibly spacious for two people and the balcony overlooking the streets of Rome were an added bonus (even though it is an extremely busy/loud street.) Plus the bed is super comfy! This is a great spot to stay when exploring Rome and I would highly recommend booking this place for your next trip!;7
54;5;2022-10-18;86;Patrizio was very responsive and helpful! The location was great and the cafe merulana around the corner had delicious lasagna and food. We stayed here with 4 of us girls total and it was wonderful;9
55;5;2022-10-18;87;Muy buena ubicación, a 400 metros del Metro, confortable y cómodo. Patrizio se comportó muy amablemente y estuvo siempre dispuesto a colaborar con nosotros;10
56;5;2022-10-24;88;Patrizio is helpful and friendly. Suite is not far from the main landsmarks;8
57;5;2022-10-25;89;The place is close to everything! You can walk, take the bus or metro. Plus it has an excellent view. The place is very clean, has nice furniture and the kitchen has everything to cook. I went with my family, I have three small kids and it was perfect. Also the host patricio was in time to give me the keys and very friendly. I definitely recommend it!!!;10
58;5;2022-10-27;90;Terrific location. Lovely apartment. Wonderfully soft and comfy bed. Patrizio was such a lovely young man and couldn't have been more courteous and helpful. Try the 'Irish' pub around the corner, had a melt in the mouth steak .... No more than 25 / 30 Euro by taxi to the main attractions. Bus stop is right outside the front door. Buses can be a problem though as they don't have any stop announcements so you are left guessing or annoying people for help, found it a bit stressful in busy crowds. You are right in the hub of central traffic so there is a lot of street noise but fairly quiet inside the apartment, just a constant hum and occasional siren that can't be avoided... Part of the city ambience. The building is very old and impressive and you have your own balcony which is great and has a terrific outlook. Great little shops for coffee and such on either side of the front door. Patrizio was able to collect me from the airport and take me to the accommodation for a fee about 15 euro less than the taxi, which was a great relief after a long day travelling.;10
59;5;2022-10-28;91;Patrizo welcomed us upon arrival. The location of the apartment was very central. The apartment was exactly as pictured in the ad. ;10
60;5;2022-10-29;92;Great place! Host was super helpful and friendly! Definitely recommend. ;10
61;5;2022-11-04;93;Ciao , I had an amanzing experience in your house ! Thank you ! Ciao Ciao;7
62;5;2022-11-11;94;Patrizio was an amazing host! This was my wife and selfs first trip in Europe and I couldn't have found a better place to stay or host. The flat is very centrally located, very close walking distance to Coliseum and metro. I was surprised how easy taking the metro was and it took you right to the high speed trains to tour the rest of Italy. The balcony was amazing and great views, the bed was also super comfortable. Allot of amazing cafe and restaurants walking distance. I highly recommend. Thanks for an amazing stay Patrizio!!! ;10
63;5;2022-11-14;95;Patrizio is an amazing host with a very unique place to stay !;10
64;5;2022-11-19;96;Staying with Patrizio was amazing. He is a fantastic host with great recommendations and the place is incredible. Would definitely recommend and stay again. ;9
65;5;2022-11-27;97;Comfortable flat. Close to the Coliseum (about 7 minutes) and the city center. Great host!;10
66;5;2022-11-29;98;Same as my last review!;10
67;6;2022-09-23;99;What a place! This is a large, bright, and clean apartment, newly remodeled, and in the middle of Trastevere (not on a noisy street). The attention to detail was pretty astonishing: Wi-Fi with tablet, flat screen with cable, water in the fridge, etc. Lorenzo is also very nice and accommodating: he kindly helped us order a taxi for the morning late a night. I'd definitely return. Do not hesitate on this place. It's just great, easy, and convenient.;8
68;6;2022-09-24;100;The apartment was very nice and clean, and the staff was really helpful and waited for us over an half of an hour when we were late to check in. Overall I would highly recommend. They even offered a iPad for our use.;10
69;6;2022-09-29;101;We couldn't have wished for a better place to stay in Rome. The location was just perfect, a walking distance to all the sights, yet away from the tourist crowds. This area of Trastevere was very local and quiet and at the same time just steps away from all the action and very central to Rome's best sightseeing. The apartment was spacious, clean and bright with so many hotel-like details, slippers, toiletries, hair-dryer, nespresso, etc. The apartment is on the 3rd floor with great window views into the Rome's intimate side streets. Wifi worked fine, the shower was perfectly hot all the time, and a large bed was extremely comfortable to sleep on after long days of sightseeing. Lorenzo was a phenomenal host, he showed us the things we need to know in the neighborhood and walked us to the store to get a SIM cards for our phones. He was fantastic, and we don't want to stay anywhere else when we are in Rome next time.;7
70;6;2022-10-02;102;Love the area.. LOVED the apartment. It had absolutely everything you could want. The location is fantastic. Lorenzo was an absolute professional. We are already planning our next trip and will definitely stay there again :);10
71;6;2022-10-03;103;Lorenzo met us downstairs, carried up our bags, explained everything and made recommendations for eating etc. The apartment far exceeded our expectations in terms of cleanliness, homeliness and spaciousness. The sheets were snow white and crisp, the towels were soft and lovely. I can't speak highly enough of this wonderful apartment and I'm very sorry it won't be available when we return to Rome in a couple of weeks. I have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone. Fantastic value.;9
72;7;2022-02-09;104;Wonderful location! Quiet apartment that’s Walking distance to many great restaurants.;10
73;7;2022-02-17;105;La casa è piccolina, ma accogliente. Posizione davvero strategica, vicina a tanti bei locali, è stato facile raggiungere tutti gi incantevoli posti di Roma. Estremamente gentili e disponibili;9
74;7;2022-02-21;106;Great location in a quiet part of Rome. It was as described - 2 floors, a ground floor and the upstairs which hosted the bedroom and bathroom. Our host was communicative and met us at check in. Would definitely stay here again.;10
75;7;2022-02-24;107;Great location, apartment is perfect for a city break. Small but comfortable and has everything you need!;10
76;7;2022-02-27;108;Idéalement situé, parfait pour un weekend en amoureux;10
77;7;2022-03-02;109;The location was great. So many options for eating. A mile to walk to the Colosseum and Vatican City. A good place to sleep. If you are planning on staying in for some nights it’s a little small for that. Very clean spot.;8
78;7;2022-03-10;110;We enjoyed our stay at the apartment. The location in trestevere is fantastic, and the room was perfect for a brief stay in Rome.;10
79;7;2022-03-13;111;Amazing place & host!;7
80;7;2022-03-21;112;wow great little find,perfect location, great Cafe,bar amd amazing restaurant round the corner from here. never done air bnb before amd marina made it so easy, leaving our bags,check in everything. great bar Pimms Carmel restaurant 👌 amust;10
81;7;2022-03-24;113;It was a great location and we enjoyed our time in the city.;10
82;7;2022-03-28;114;Location is awesome and at a walking distance from many sightseeing points and great restaurants. The place is cozy and clean. Recommended!;9
83;7;2022-04-09;115;Very professional, kind & very easy to communicate with. Gave a great pizza restaurant recommendation. We actually ate there 3 times because it was so good, and absolutely the best & most quiet location, especially since it was in Trastevere, and had very easy access with direct access from the street with a bus stops, news stand, and grocery within a few steps from the apartment. Also, was given directions to a pharmacy within a 4 min walk away to get Covid tested before returning back to the US, so very convenient. I highly recommend staying at this great Rome apartment.;10
84;7;2022-04-11;116;Great location in a lively neighborhood. Had all the essentials. Host was great with communication and helped me when I had questions.;8
85;7;2022-04-15;117;Escalier très abrupte;10
86;7;2022-04-20;118;Faultless apartment in brilliant location. Great communication throughout from the host. Highly recommended.;10
87;7;2022-04-23;119;Marina’s apartment was in a fantastic location in Trastevere - surrounded by plenty of restaurant choices and only a short walk to ruins and other sites. Though in a lively neighborhood, the apartment was quiet and we were not disrupted at night. The apartment is 2 floors - ground and narrow stairs up to ‘first’ floor - with the TV room and kitchenette down below and bedroom/bathroom above. The shower is a stall in the bedroom, a bit narrow and only a few minutes of hot water so plan accordingly with whomever else may want to use it. The bed was large and comfortable. The hosts were very accommodating with our arrival and departure, and arranged a car to take us to the airport. Perfect for a short stay - we stayed there for 3 nights. The disposable slippers are also a nice touch :);7
88;7;2022-05-03;120;Die Wohnung ist mitten im schönen Trastevere ..super zentral und doch sehr ruhig nachts zum Schlafen! Man ist überall bei jeder Sehenswürdigkeit sehr schnell zu Fuß! Die Wohnung war sehr sauber! Die Kommunikation mit Gianni war immer perfekt und sehr schnell und haben jede Unterstützung erhalten und der Taxiservice zum Flughafen ist prima! Vielen Dank 🙏🏻 und jederzeit gerne wieder;10
89;8;2022-01-06;121;The location of the place is very strategic with very worth it price. Giordano is also very helpful within our stay and with the information regarding the city of Rome.;10
90;8;2022-01-07;122;This place was very spacious and clean, and it was in an amazing location. If we ever return to Rome, we would love to stay here again!;9
91;8;2022-01-08;123;A spacious place and great value in an awesome location. Giordano was a great host. Highly recommended.;10
92;8;2022-01-11;124;Wonderful location. Such a great neighborhood. So much to do everywhere, and very easy to get around. Very spacious studio and great kitchen.;10
93;8;2022-01-13;125;Giodano's place was just as advertised. Right in the center of Ancient Rome!!!! The apartment itself is very spacious and I love the shower. The check in/out process was very smooth and I love the ceilings. This is a great stay for anyone considering getting the Ancient Rome experience.;10
94;8;2022-01-19;126;Firstly let me say that the apartment is quite nice, however there is black mould in the bathroom and a bar in the street downstairs. The overflow for the bar at night is outside , underneath the apartment. It was so loud I ended up calling the police at 1am after repeatedly asking the crowd to keep the noise down. The bar does takeaway drinks and has rented the space outside the building next door where the apartments are located so it’s unavoidable that the problem will continue. This was a Monday night so I’d hate to be there on a weekend. There is also major construction going on next door which is very loud and starts at 6am. All in all we got about 3 hrs sleep, yelled at a few drunks downstairs to quite down and cancelled the booking. The host was good enough to refund for the booking after arguing the point a bit. I had messaged at 12pm , 1am and 3am, to let him know what was going on. He has three rentals here but did not respond later in the night. With the noise from the bar area downstairs underneath the apartment it’s not suitable for sleeping unless you have earplugs. We moved the next morning and the process messed up an entire day if our holiday in Rome. Lost our bookings for the day and generally left a bad impression of the integrity of the host. Not impressed.;6
95;8;2022-01-22;127;Posizione fantastica, self check rapidissimo e ultradiscreto (ferma restando la massima disponibilità dell’host a richiesta..) e ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo! Ci torneremo!👍;7
96;8;2022-01-24;128;The location of this AirBnB is fantastic and Giordano was a great host. The space is functional and perfect for two people. We would absolutely stay here again!;9
97;8;2022-01-29;129;A pretty apartment in such a great neighborhood, we really enjoyed our stay next to many different cafes and restaurants in the old town, and with colosseum right around the corner. The apartment where nicely prepared for us and easy to check in and come & go throughout the stay. Giordano is a fantastic host always available and very helpfull. Will definitely recommend for others who want to experience the beautiful city as well.;10
98;8;2022-02-01;130;We loved our stay in Rome. This apartment was the perfect location. Right by the colosseum, and yummy restaurants all around! The bed was really comfortable, and the whole room was cozy but also spacious and comfortable!;8
99;8;2022-02-04;131;Absolutely fantastic flat in the centre of Rome, spacious, clean and warm. Giordano is a wonderful host, would definitely recommend staying there.;10
100;8;2022-02-06;132;Un appartement très bien placé ! Très jolie décoration et très fonctionnel.;10
101;8;2022-02-09;133;Great place to stay, perfect location, just a few minutes from the main touristic places, good host.;8
102;8;2022-02-12;134;Be aware this is an apartment in the city and cities have noise. It was quite loud until 22:00 but after that quieted down nicely.;10
103;8;2022-02-16;135;Die Wohnung ist super schön, groß und ein bequemes Bett. Und vor allem mitten drin in der City.;7
104;8;2022-02-17;136;Perfect position in Monti;9
105;9;2021-05-08;137;Davvero tutto perfetto: appartamento e zona molto belli, a due passi dal Colosseo. Rocco è super disponibile e gentile, non posso fare altro che consigliarlo!!;9
106;9;2021-05-11;138;Beautiful studio and thank you for all;10
107;9;2021-05-14;139;Fantastic location, quiet building, and attentively run by Rocco. The only thing missing was windows! However, if you spend all day outside in beautiful Rome, you’ll hardly notice.;10
108;9;2021-05-17;140;Rocco davvero supergentilissimo e sopratutto sempre disponibile.. L'appartamento si trova in una zona comodissima, a 8 minuti circa a piedi dal Colosseo :) Davvero consigliato!;10
109;9;2021-05-21;141;bello mono locale confortevole tranquillo;10
110;9;2021-05-26;142;L'appartement est parfait pour un couple qui souhaite seulement y dormir : bien placé (15min du Colisée), Rocco est un hôte disponible et attentionné (tout ce qu'il fallait pour nos petit-dejeuners était à disposition). Cependant il faut quand même noté qu'il n'y a pas de fenêtre dans le logement qui est très humide (deshumidificateur sur place) et bruyant (porte de l'immeuble qui claque, voisin qu'on entend comme s'ils étaient avec nous). Pour autant ce n'était pas dérangeant comme nous n'y sommes resté que 3 nuits et nous y dormions uniquement. Je recommande le rapport qualité/prix;8
111;9;2021-06-04;143;모든 것이 다 완벽했던 숙소입니다! 위치가 특히 너무 좋았고, 숙소에 없을 게 없었어서 너무 편했어요 1층이라 무거운 캐리어 있어도 문제 없었구요. 주방은 없어요! 전자레인지랑 커피머신은 쓸 수 있습니당 호스트가 이것저것 간식을 많이 챙겨주는 덕분에 주방 따로 필요 없었어요:) 추천합니다! Thanks Rocco!;10
112;10;2021-01-31;144;Una casa elegante, pulita e accogliente con una vista mozzafiato! Ve lo consiglio vivamente!;10
113;10;2021-02-09;145;Casa molto confortevole, vista bellissima, consigliato;10
114;10;2021-02-16;146;Vista incredibile, appartamento molto spazioso, luminoso e con una vista incredibile. Avevo anche dimenticato una camicia e l’host è stato gentilissimo e tempestivo nella comunicazione Consiglio assolutamente;7
115;10;2021-02-21;147;Casa molto carina, check in da remoto che ti permette di arrivare quando vuoi, mancava la carta igienica in bagno. Tutto sommato un’esperienza positiva, location molto suggestiva!;9
116;10;2021-03-08;148;La vista del Cupolone illuminato la notte ripaga del prezzo della casa .... quanto sei bella Roma !!!;8
117;10;2021-03-09;149;Consigliatissimo. Molto pulito, curato, host disponibile e molta privacy. Ottimo servizio.;10
118;10;2021-03-18;150;Appartamento elegante con vista magnifica, spazioso e curato nei dettagli. Consigliato;10
119;10;2021-03-22;151;La casa è bellissima con la vista meravigliosa!;10
120;11;2021-03-03;152;Vania è gentilissima, anche se mai incontrata. La casa è in un posto silenzioso e ben collegato. Peccato che sia un semi-interrato. Per breve tempo è un buon compromesso;10
121;11;2021-03-09;153;Ottimo posto dove soggiornare, rapporto qualità/prezzo buono. Peccato per la camera che non si riscalda al massimo non avendo la porta e la finestra non si chiude;10
122;11;2021-03-12;154;"Host very Ok (after I got to the apartment I understood why she is so kind and prompt) the interest of the host was to rent that apartment, not to be improved. I was very disappointed by what I found ... the apartment is under the floor with a very ugly iron door that you can hardly close (you break your hands), a sofa in the ""living room"" that was disgusting to sit in the kitchen everything was glued, in the bathroom the walls were peeled and the window does not close, in the bedroom the window does not close, the handle is broken and you stay with it cracked, the bedroom door is replaced by a white curtain. !!!! there are no radiators !!!! just small radiators that once the room temperature is off are similar to the outside. I'm not talking about the bed anymore, awful! Lingerie with a smell of status! It was still awful !!!! I do not recommend to anyone!";10
123;11;2021-03-18;155;Alloggio sito al piano interrato, dalle foto sembra carino, ma quando entri la sensazione è un'altre, spazi bui e umidi, riscaldamento con stufette elettriche di fortuna, luce del bagno non funzionante, tamponata con lampada al fondo del bagno. Non c'è ne microonde ne forno elettrico, solo piastre ad induzione. Porte esterne rivestite con nylon, pavimento della cucina sfondato. Ho speso poco, ma allo stesso prezzo ho avuto esperienza sicuramente migliori. Host comunque gentile.;7
124;11;2021-03-20;156;L’ambiente é confortevole e pulito. Molto pulito. La casa è accogliente e ben organizzata. La proprietaria, Vania è come sempre gentile e disponibile. La zona è strategica, è super centrale e ben collegata anche a piedi. Sono venuto a Roma per lavoro ovviamente, ma con tutte queste restrizioni, potersi permettere di essere vicini a tante zone d’interesse è una nota più che positiva. Questo è il mio rifugio romano.;9
125;11;2021-03-21;157;Casa pulita e accogliente. collocata in una zona centralissima ma tranquilla . Ho soggiornato per motivi di lavoro come spesso mi capita a Roma e tornerò in questa casa sicuramente . Che dire poi di vania ? Semplicemente meravigliosa;10
126;11;2021-05-30;158;Appartamento adorabile, posizione centrale e host impeccabile e gentilissima. Se avete bisogno di un alloggio a Roma, vi consiglio caldamente di soggiornare da Vania, non ve ne pentirete!;10
127;11;2021-06-06;159;Vania è una ottima host, ha accolto tutte le mie richieste in modo positivo e ha offerto una location comoda e confortevole.;10
128;12;2022-04-18;160;Un appartement confortable en fond de cour (donc plutôt calme pour sa position géographique : à proximité de la fontaine de Trevi). Super emplacement pour rayonner vers les quartiers historiques;10
129;12;2022-04-19;161;Great little Airbnb, perfect for a small group. Incredibly well located. Hosts were amazing and went above and beyond to accommodate our needs to drop off our luggage. We loved the character and the cleanliness of the place. Can’t wait to come back again!;7
130;12;2022-04-22;162;Nous avons passé un super séjour à Rome dans l’appartement de Giorgio. Il nous avait communiqué toutes les informations au départ pour faciliter notre arrivée ( emplacement du parking, plan etc…). L’appartement est idéalement situé à quelques mètres de la fontaine de Trevi et à proximité de nombreux centres d’intérêts . Nous reviendrons avec plaisir .;10
131;12;2022-04-26;163;The apartment is very comfortable and clean and the location is great;8
132;12;2022-04-29;164;We enjoyed our stay - the place was in a good location only a 2min walk to the Trevi fountain and in a walkable distance to lots of other attractions. Very clean place and helpful communication dealing with early check-in. It was good find for our 3night stay :);10
133;12;2022-05-02;165;Giorgio’s place was clean and welcoming, nothing was too much trouble and communication was brilliant! We were met and shown to our apartment as Giorgio said we would be, he arranged our Taxi to and from the airport for us and gave us tips on trips and restaurants! Location was fabulous and so quiet considering how close you are to the Trevi Fountain! I would highly recommend it and would stay there again if I’m ever in Rome again - Thank you Giorgio! Xxx;10
134;12;2022-05-04;166;Location was very convenient to popular destinations. It was easy to check in and check out. The apartment was very spacious.;10
135;12;2022-05-05;167;Exceptional stay. Will come back.;9
136;12;2022-05-08;168;Giorgio’s place is amazing, only a few steps from the Trevi fountain. It was nice being able to get up a bit early (or late in the evening) and visit the fountain without the crowds. The apartment is centrally located so its a short walk to most tourist spots in Rome. Giorgio was a great guest and made sure we had everything we needed. I would stay here again if I’m ever back in Rome.;10
137;12;2022-05-11;169;Superb location near Trevi Fountain. Giorgio was very accommodating. Arranged for a driver to meet us upon landing in FCO which was extremely helpful. Great communication before and during our stay.;10
138;12;2022-05-12;170;L’appartamento si trova all’interno di un condominio molto curato. è molto grande e spazioso, adatto anche a due coppie, ben fornito (dalla cucina alla lavatrice) e ben curato! Senza ombra di dubbi la posizione, a dir poco eccezionale, da una marcia in più. si trova infatti a due passi dalla magnifica Fontana di Trevi e ovviamente è molto ben fornita dai mezzi e dalla vita Romana.;7
139;12;2022-05-16;171;An amazing place for our four day stay! The place is beautiful, spacious, AC was extra nice given the heat, and Thomas and the hosts were incredibly friendly and helpful. Cannot recommend enough!;10
140;12;2022-05-20;172;Absolutely amazing location in the center of Rome, having most of the must sees very close by (walking distance). Perfect communication with the host, quick response times and great suggestions.;8
141;12;2022-05-22;173;Giorgio was extremely helpful before and during our trip to Rome. The location of the apartment was very convenient to alll the sights in Rome.;8
142;13;2022-04-22;174;Absolutely wonderful location and host would 100% stay again !;10
143;13;2022-04-25;175;Excellent location;10
144;13;2022-05-09;176;Great place to stay. Right in the heart of all the cool stuff to see. Perfect little sleepover spot.;10
145;13;2022-05-18;177;Perfect location near Trevi fountain, the room was perfect to couple .. small shower;9
146;13;2022-05-21;178;Giulia was very responsive and helpful both before and during the stay! The location of this property was absolutely perfect! We chose it due to its proximity to major attractions such as the Trevor Fountain, Pantheon, Colosseum, Spanish Steps, and Vatican City. All were within about 15 minutes walking distance. The flat was clean and despite being next to the Trevi Fountain which was packed with people, it was still very quiet. 10/10 - Would stay again!;10
147;13;2022-05-23;179;If you're looking for a fun place to stay in Rome, this apartment is perfect. You can see Trevi Fountain from the hallway window and hear the crowds below when anything fun or exciting happens. You have great options for food nearby and you can walk to many of the things to see in Rome. We had a wonderful time and would happily stay again.;10
148;13;2022-05-27;180;Perfect place to stay, just in front of the fountain with a lot of shops / restaurants / bar. Super nice !;7
149;13;2022-05-30;181;This Airbnb is an amazing location!;10
150;14;2022-09-06;182;This was the perfect location for our stay and the Airbnb was perfect for us! It was much larger then what we expected and in the central area for everything we explored, thank you!;8
151;14;2022-09-11;183;Lucia was such a lovely host and her apartment was just as amazing. Great location, clean, spacious, and comfortable amenities (for any US travelers, the bed was big and there was an overhead shower head which was great as this was where we stayed coming right off the plane);10
152;14;2022-09-13;184;Fantastic place to stay!;10
153;14;2022-09-22;185;Enjoyed our stay at Lucia's place. It was very clean and met our needs. Loved the shower. The air conditioner works just fine. Important during the Summer months. The Trevi Fountain is literally out the door to the right. It is a busy place but the apartment is at the back of the building so the tourist noise for the most part is not heard. She does have earplugs by the bed if needed. We ate breakfast there every morning..enjoying the coffee pods left for us and we supplemented it with fresh milk and yoghurt we bought at the market down the street. The location is great...easy walking distance to many sites. Good restaurants. We did have to take a taxi every now and then and when we found a taxi stand it made it easier to get from one place to another. The Pantheon is within walking distance...took taxis to the Coliseum, to the Borghese Museum and the Vatican. One note is to know that there is no car traffic on the street so if you get a taxi from the airport or the train station you are dropped off around the corner. The apartment is at number 9 and we didn't realize that the numbers on both sides don't correspond. We looked at the wrong side of the street and thought we had to walk blocks to get to number 9 when it was just round the corner to the right! We called Lucia and she worked hard to help us find our way. With luggage it was a bit challenging but we made it. The elevator is up one story. Just FYI. Everything else worked smoothly . Lucia dropped off clean towels midway through our stay. She organized a nice driver to pick us up when we headed out to the airport. He came inside and helped us get out luggage to the car. That was very appreciated. We loved Rome. It's a special place and Lucia was a lovely hostess who was quick to respond to any concerns. Thanks Lucia!;9
154;14;2022-09-28;186;Lucia made our entire stay amazing from beginning to end. She offered to book our transportation from the airport, allowed us to drop off our bags before check in, left us champagne as a welcome gift, and was so quick to respond to any question we had throughout our stay. The location is great, right by the Trevi Fountain, so you are in the middle of the action as soon as you check in. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend Lucia’s flat to anyone looking to stay in Rome.;10
155;14;2022-10-02;187;Lucia’s Airbnb was GORGEOUS. The location is unreal and Lucia made check in a breeze. This apartment is in a fantastic area of Rome and we had a blast - absolutely would stay here again on a future visit, we loved it!;10
156;14;2022-10-06;188;Great place and location!;10
157;14;2022-10-10;189;Very nice and well appointed apartment, and the host is kind and communicative. We were confused and thought the unit had a view of Trevi Fountain, which it does not, but that may be our fault based on our reading of the listing. Overall a very nice place to stay, and we do recommend it!;10
158;14;2022-10-11;190;I had a great stay!;10
159;14;2022-10-17;191;Excellent host, quick response times, very thoughtful and attentive to every need. Helped coordinate transport from airport. Great location in center of tourist area;10
160;14;2022-10-19;192;Lucia went above and beyond and made Roma the best stay I’ve had abroad . The apartment is right at the trevi fountain above a cute cafe . It was beautiful inside and felt like home . Lucia even went above and beyond and held our luggage for a few hours after check out so we could visit the Vatican . She didn’t have to do that and I will forever be grateful and always stay w her when I’m in Roma .;8
161;14;2022-10-20;193;Perfect for our 1 night in Rome! Truly a great hosts that cares about her guests, we appreciated all of the extra touches and her effort to accommodate our early arrival. Highly recommend!;10
162;14;2022-10-21;194;This apartment is located in a building just by the Trevi fountain. You can see if from the hallway, not from the unit - but the view from the hallway is great and away from the crowd. This is a great place to stay if you want to be close to the sights in this area. This is one of the most accommodating hosts I’ve ever stayed with! Lucia even booked us a taxi driver to get us to the airport early in the morning the day we had to leave. Also, be sure to wake up early in the AM to see the fountain with no crowd! At 5:45 am there was no one there.;10
163;14;2022-10-23;195;We loved our stay! Perfect location and a lovely suite to relax after a day in the bustling area around Trevi Fountain. Thank you Lucia and Daniele for being such fantastic hosts.;7
164;15;2021-11-13;196;Wunderbare Lage, in nächster Nähe zum Stadtzentrum und Bahnhof Termini, aber die unmittelbare Umgebung ist ein schönes, wenig touristisches Viertel. Sehr zu empfehlen.;10
165;15;2021-11-14;197;Nice, clean, well decorated room. Easy walk from the train station and on a quiet street near the important areas.;9
166;15;2021-11-15;198;Host molto disponibile, arredamento moderno e curato;10
167;15;2021-11-18;199;This location is super centric a few minutes from the main attraction , train stations and full of retail store and restaurants . The down part of this is it doesn’t count with a private parking as a stated in the listing and also other reviews are right the apartment cleanliness is questionable the bed sheets were stained and dirty . so seems to me is just a neglect from the host . If you don’t need a parking spot and get a new or clean sheet is a great place;10
168;15;2021-11-19;200;Quick and easy check-in check-out, great price and location;10
169;15;2021-11-25;201;Cute apartment in a great location. Short walk to attractions and close to other means of transportation ( bus, taxi, metro etc). Host provided us with a picnic basket full of breakfast foods for a quick breakfast on the go which was a nice touch!;10
170;15;2021-11-28;202;Super séjour chez Emanuela. Le logement est très bien situé, propre et moderne. Nous avons beaucoup apprécié la et Emanuela est une hote géniale et réactive;8
171;15;2021-12-01;203;dust everywhere, floor uncleaned and unswept, bad smell in the bathroom, kettle dirty from previous guests.;10
172;16;2021-02-22;204;La camera era molto carina e decisamente pulita, il checkin è stato rapido e professionale. L'ambiente era più piccolo di quanto mi aspettassi, ma comunque assolutamente vivibile. Purtroppo abbiamo avuto un imprevisto familiare e abbiamo dovuto lasciare la stanza prima di dormirci effettivamente, per cui non so come sia l'ambiente la notte, ma comunque ci tornerei!;10
173;16;2021-02-26;205;Appartement très bien situé et au calme. A quelques pas du Colisée. Il est équipé avec tout ce dont vous avez besoin pour passer un bon séjour. De plus le propriétaire est très réactif aux messages et est très arrangeant. Je recommande !;10
174;16;2021-05-10;206;Perfetto!;10
175;16;2021-05-12;207;Un alloggio carinissimo e molto consigliato, sia per come si presenta, che per la zona, la comodità del letto e la cortesia;7
176;16;2021-06-11;208;Great place, close to the metro and Coliseum, very clean and well maintained;9
177;16;2021-06-20;209;La casa está muy bien. La comunicación fue excelente. La limpieza 10/10. La ubicación también es idonea: está cerca de todo en un lugar sin mucho ruido. La cama cómoda y todo muy bien equipado. Sin duda un 100% recomendable. Muchas gracias por la estancia.;10
178;16;2021-06-25;210;Great appartement near the center of Rome;8
179;16;2021-06-28;211;Grazie mille Néstor!!!!;10
180;17;2022-06-01;212;Nice property in excellent location, close to public transport, restaurants and Colosseum. Friendly and helpful hosts.;10
181;17;2022-06-03;213;Amazing and cute loft! Perfect stay;7
182;17;2022-06-08;214;Brilliant place to explore Rome from. The location is unbeatable, everything is easy to walk to. The loft is nicely decorated and felt very comfortable. We used self check-in and the experience was seemless. Communication was fantastic, always had a response within minutes. We'll definitely stay here again next time we visit Rome.;10
183;17;2022-06-10;215;The property is well decorated. However, from the pictures I cannot tell it’s not a loft actually, it’s a commercial property in the street. Which means other than door, you’ll have no windows. When closing the door, you could only use electrical to light up and no way for fresh air to communicate. Another issue is that since it’s the commercial property located on street, it was super noisy. I would say I stayed awake all night. Truly not feel well. Those disadvantages you cannot tell from the description of the Airbnb.;10
184;17;2022-06-11;216;Gian's place is super awesome because it has A/C! This helped us beat the sweltering heat in Rome.;10
185;17;2022-06-13;217;We loved our stay. The location was perfect and the apartment was well appointed.;10
186;17;2022-06-15;218;We were so grateful to stay at Gian Marco’s place! We stayed overnight before catching a flight home. He was so helpful in arranging a driver to take us to the airport. This is a great place to rest your head after long travels!;9
187;18;2022-06-27;219;Suck a horrible experience. Arranged an early check in with Guila for 11am. But upon arriving a gentleman named Luca told us we couldn't get in till 11:30am. So we had to stay outside in the heat with tons of luggage. 11:40 Luca arrived, he told us we could not use the elevator so we had to carry all luggage to 3rd floor with no help. The place had yet to be cleaned. We were told cleaner will come at 12pm. Cleaner arrived at 2:04pm. Did a poor job at cleaning. Its Covid, we had to wipe everything down ourselves. The AC didn't work. It was 100° outside. Guila nor the people that work for her offered any help. Not to mention all the mold in the bathroom. The fridge didn't work either. I will say it is a great location. But being our first time in Rome this experience left a bad taste for us;10
188;18;2022-07-05;220;Nice place. Good location. Close to all major sights. Our family, 5 persons, enjoyd the appartement. Good aircondition! Good communication with Giulia. We had a great holiday!;8
189;18;2022-07-08;221;Good location and close to attractions. Excellent communication and friendly host.;10
190;18;2022-07-15;222;Such an amazing location, this was perfect for my girlfriends and I.;10
191;18;2022-07-16;223;Good spot to land. Cute and clean with fresh linens and towels. Also has functioning air conditioning in all rooms.;10
192;18;2022-07-19;224;This apartment was well located between Vatican and ancient sites. Cafe and restaurants outside the doorstep was very handy. Antonio met us at the cab when we arrived. Having the transportation booked for us from the airport made landing in a new city very welcoming. Thank you!;10
193;18;2022-07-24;225;Lovely apartment in a great location. Very clean and comfortable 👍;9
194;18;2022-07-26;226;The perfect flat in the perfect part of Rome! Our stay was magnificent, would stay here over and over again!!;10
195;19;2022-10-30;227;My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at Santa Nara. We flew into the Fiumicino airport and Emanuela helped organise a private ride from the airport to our Airbnb which was super helpful! Although we were only visiting Rome for two days, we had everything we needed and the room was very clean and cosy. We were also just a very close walking distance from the Colosseum and many other famous Roman landmarks. Emanuela as a lovely hostess and stayed in communication with us! Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Rome. 🥰 thanks again, Emanuela!;10
196;19;2022-11-02;228;This space was perfect for my husband and I for our few days in Rome. The room is spacious and equipped with all necessities, along with a comfy bed and Netflix! The check in process was incredibly detailed and easy to follow and it was very easy to keep in communication with Emanuela. The daily cleaning services were an added bonus!;10
197;19;2022-11-07;229;The bathroom had a really gross smell and the door lock on the bathroom was broken. Other than that, it was really great and perfect location!! Id still recommend though;7
198;19;2022-11-14;230;Chambre bien située proche du centre historique de Rome pratique pour une ou deux nuits.;10
199;19;2022-11-15;231;Espacio cómodo y muy limpio, nos dejo un desayuno en la recámara;8
200;19;2022-11-22;232;Everything was as described. Walking distance to the colosseum. Great restaurants near by. Emanuela was great!! Quick to respond to text messages. Nice and quiet area.;10
201;20;2021-06-06;233;Ottima soluzione per una coppia od una persona. Appartamento ordinato, pulito e comodo, soprattutto per la possibilità di recarsi a piedi verso la zona Colosseo/centro e/o ben collegata con i mezzi pubblici;10
202;20;2021-06-07;234;Ideal location, close to Termini. Clean room, nice aesthetic. The bed was comfortable. Friendly host who communicated clearly. Self check-in with very clear instructions. There’s a bus stop right when you leave the Airbnb, which is very convenient. Would recommend for a city trip to Rome!;10
203;20;2021-06-09;235;For this price it was ok;9
204;20;2021-06-10;236;impossibile trovare parcheggio!;10
205;20;2021-06-11;237;Tutto ottimo!;10
206;21;2021-12-22;238;Very nice spot in great location. Balcony is wonderful. The shower is very small and ceilings are low in certain areas.;10
207;21;2022-01-06;239;Loved it here! They were great hosts. I want to move in. What an amazing location.;7
208;21;2022-01-17;240;We had a great stay! The location was great and close to all the major sites around Rome.;8
209;21;2022-01-23;241;We had a great time! The apt. is in an amazing location and the balcony was wonderful. The apartment is on an amazing street, full of shops and cafes, and super close to all of the attractions in the city center. The bed was super comfortable, the building had a lot of charm :) Would def. recommend to friends visiting Rome.;10
210;21;2022-01-28;242;This place is very charming and has excellent location close to the Spanish Steps. We had trouble getting the hot water but rest was all good. Highly recommend.;10
211;21;2022-01-29;243;Location is amazing, and the space itself is great. Beware of the 4th floor walk up, although the stairs are decently wide. The shower can be an issue if you are above 6ft tall as well. I also had an issue with the hot water not really working, but we only stayed one day so it really couldn’t be addressed. Otherwise, this place is beautiful, in a good spot, with a great balcony.;10
212;21;2022-01-31;244;Posto super consigliato al centro di Roma con terrazza! Host sempre disponibile.;9
213;21;2022-02-18;245;Bellissimo appartamento vicino Piazza di Spagna. Casa confortevole e comoda. Dotata dei servizi essenziali. Periodo perfetto primavera-estate per godersi la massimo il terrazzo. Host gentilissimo e sempre disponibile per ogni richiesta.;10

216;22;2021-05-09;248;Il soggiorno da Franco è stato molto tranquillo e piacevole. La stanza si trova in una zona attrezzata e comoda, da Pigneto si possono raggiungere le varie metro. Se si ha fortuna si può trovare anche parcheggio gratuito. La notte è stata tranquilla e silenziosa.;10
217;22;2021-05-11;249;Alloggio molto bello e comodo, soprattutto considerando che si trova le cuore del Pigneto. Rapporto qualità prezzo super e proprietario molto gentile e disponibile!;10
218;22;2021-05-16;250;FRanco è stato molto disponibile per tutto. Lìappartamento è una stanza riadattata a monolocale con tutti i servizi necessari. La posizione è ottimale per visitare la città, nel centro del quartiere Pigneto, a due passi dalla stazione metro ma in una strada tranquilla e appartata. Lo consiglio se si viaggia per piacere o per lavoro e si cerca una sistemazione centrale in un quartiere dinamico.;10
219;22;2021-06-04;251;Clean place, lively spot in Roma;9
220;22;2021-06-07;252;Nice place, Franco is very helpful!;10

El mejor host, super atento, flexible con el check in y check out. Excelente comunicación!! Definitivamente nos estaremos quedando aquí la próxima vez que visitemos Roma!;10
224;23;2022-03-19;256;Great location, quite minimal room.;10
225;23;2022-03-22;257;très bon rapport qualité-prix, très bien placé, petit déjeuner compris, parfait pour un séjour à Rome.;8
226;23;2022-03-29;258;The room is ideally situated near the coliseum. It's a great spot to access some must see (coliseum, Trevi, panthéon, foro romano etc ..) in walking distance. There's the Carvour metro station at few steps that permits to access Termini station in few minutes. The street is full of nice bars and restaurants. the room is comfortable and include a bathroom. Everything is there to make a nice breakfast (electric kettle, a small fridge). and the host is providing coffee, tea, croissants, orange juice... The host is very kind. we had great communication. 100% recommended!;10
227;23;2022-03-30;259;La struttura è perfetta per chi ha bisogno di un punto di appoggio al centro di Roma. Collocazione impagabile. Rapporto qualità-prezzo eccellente. Accoglienza estremamente cordiale;10
228;23;2022-04-01;260;The place was exactly as advertised, check-in was super easy, and the location can't be beat if you're looking to see the most popular attractions in Rome. Don't hesitate to book!;10
229;23;2022-04-04;261;Super netter Host. Zimmer und Lage sind perfekt, um die Stadt in 3 Tagen zu erkunden;9
230;23;2022-04-07;262;I had a great stay at Le Camere. The location couldn't have been better. close to the Colosseum, a plethora of restaurants and bars, and a 15 minute walk to Termini Station. The host was friendly, provided assistance with easy check-in instructions, and personally helped me with my luggage. The actual room was comfortable and provided me with a peaceful night of rest. Overall was a great stay!;10
231;23;2022-04-10;263;Camera semplice ma dotata di quanto necessario. La posizione è fantastica e il rapporto qualità-prezzo ottimo. Host molto accogliente, ci ha concesso di lasciare i bagagli anche oltre l'orario di check-out.;10
232;23;2022-04-14;264;Great location and lovely staff.;8
233;23;2022-04-19;265;This place was absolutely perfect. Very minimalistic but had just what you needed. Perfect location to some of the major attractions and and felt very safe. Le camere was very nice and also recommended some of his favorite spots in the area. Would definitely stay again;10
234;23;2022-04-22;266;We missed our stay;10
235;24;2021-12-12;267;Perfect location - a lovely little Roman apartment close to the main train station and with all the ancient wonders of Rome on your doorstep. Easy check in and great host in Giordano. Couldn't have asked for me and hope to be back soon!;10
236;24;2021-12-14;268;Un lugar limpio , Excelente ubicación y muy cómodo;9
237;24;2021-12-18;269;Amazing location. Beautiful and spacious apartment with all the amenities you could need.;10
238;24;2021-12-19;270;Beautiful room in a wonderful location!;9
239;24;2022-01-04;271;Appartamento in un ottima posizione per visitare Roma. Super pulito e con tutti i confort. Grazie ancora. Ottimo soggiorno;10
240;24;2022-01-26;272;Great apartment right in the middle of a vibrant neighborhood with a super local feel. Comfortable bed. Laundry. Everything you need. We cooked many meals and made sure with a Spartan but sufficient kitchen. Every request was immediately fulfilled though they were few. Giordano is always quick to respond making check in and out a breeze. Looking forward to staying again.;10
241;24;2022-01-31;273;Giordano's apartment is beautiful. Perfect location - right behind the colesseum and within walking distance of everything. Apartment has everything that's needed;10
242;24;2022-02-01;274;Persona molto gentile;7
243;25;2022-07-27;275;The apartment itself was perfectly adequate, with a good location and a great view! It was also clean. Albeit, there were some ants and the fridge didn’t properly seal. The most unfortunate part of this listing was the host herself. She hides the 30 euro cash cleaning fee at the bottom of her listing, which is an obvious and suspicious ploy to bag unsuspecting consumers. In addition, we found out after reading other reviews, that the cleaner is actually her mother! Just seems like a way for Vita and her mother to get a little extra money, tax and Airbnb-fee free. Lastly, she asked us to leave a good review, after having been fully unresponsive when we pressed her on the cleaning fee. The apartment was good, the host was not!;8
244;25;2022-07-28;276;"This apartment was wonderful. The location and the view are absolutely incredible, and those are the greatest qualities here. We were only in town for one night, so this was excellent for us to be in such a central location with gorgeous views from our windows (a true ""wow"" factor). The host was really helpful in coordinating early check-in and a driver from the airport. the cleaning person met us at the building and showed us what we needed to know. Everyone was VERY nice and welcoming, and it really made the final day of a busy trip across Europe a lovely one. Thanks so much!";10
245;25;2022-07-30;277;Perfect location! Everything we had on our bucket list was within walking distance! You absolutely cannot beat the view of the city from the window. The apartment is not very big and the bed is a pull out couch but we had a great sleep and didn’t intend to spend much time in the room when everything is so close. The AC did have a little trouble keeping up but with the weather being as hot as it was it was understandable and she had a fan setup already to move the air around. Vita was kind enough to set up a driver to meet us at the airport and offer us an early check in. Thank you!;10
246;25;2022-08-04;278;This location cannot be beat if you want to be in the center of the historical area. Just minutes walk from the Pantheon, the Colosseum, the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps and a stones throw from the Roman Forum. The host was great. They were quick to answer any questions that we had and they also provided an extensive list of places to see and eat! I would just add 1 place to eat to the list, Cantina Cantarini. It is about a 30 minute walk from the apartment, but some of the best food we have ever had! A nice place that only locals go to.;9
247;25;2022-08-05;279;Incredible location, breathtaking view, super clean, stocked with everything you need (we were so grateful for the ice cold water in the fridge after a hot day at the colosseum!), and just adorable. Vita, the host, was lovely to work with! Super fast communication, gives her guests a document with all kinds of tips and recommendations, and was incredibly accommodating to our schedule. We were able to check in early at 10am to drop our bags and get to our Colosseum tour on time, which was a lifesaver! Taxis are super close by, and you absolutely cannot beat how convenient this is to the Roman forum and Colosseum. Cannot recommend this place enough! Book it.;10
248;25;2022-08-07;280;loved our stay here! there a little elevator to take you up and the location is PERFECT. the only thing is we stayed in august and even with the ac and fan we were sweating. overall amazing airbnb in Rome and Id recommend to anyone!;10
249;25;2022-08-13;281;Wonderful Airbnb. We would love to stay in this spot again in the future;10
250;26;2022-10-24;282;Great place to stay if youʻve got a flight to catch, good location and excellent food nearby. Very close to coliseum…;8
251;26;2022-10-27;283;Meine Tochter und ich hatten einen schönen Aufenthalt bei Marisa in Rom. Das Zimmer hat alles, was man für ein paar Tage braucht inkl. Badezimmer. Es ist nicht supermodern aber sehr sauber und gemütlich. Das Zimmer ist etwas hellhörig, man hört die Gäste im anderen Zimmer und auf der Straße ist abends immer was los. Bei geschlossenem Fenster sind die Straßengeräusche aber nicht zu hören und uns haben die Geste im anderen Zimmer nicht gestört. Man muss einfach gegenseitig Rücksicht nehmen. Die Lage des Zimmers ist unschlagbar. Ganz zentral, viele Sehenswürdigkeiten sind zu Fuß zu erreichen und in der Gegend gibt es viele schöne Möglichkeiten essen zu gehen für jeden Geldbeutel.;10
252;26;2022-10-28;284;Location ottima, prezzo buono, ma il bagno non era pulito. Abbiamo apprezzato molto i consigli sul posto, e il check in era facile.;10
253;26;2022-10-29;285;ottima sistemazione in pieno centro storico, arredamento un po' demodé ma funzionale. bagno privato piccolo ma non abbiamo avuto problemi. torneremo;7
254;26;2022-11-03;286;Prime location, great value. A little breakfast and coffee was supplied daily. This airbnb is just around the corner from many fantastic restaurants and just minutes from the Colosseum. It is located just above an outdoor bar, so there is some noise at night, but nothing too bad. We had a great stay here and would definitely stay here again when we come back.;10
255;26;2022-11-05;287;Si volviera a Roma volveria al alojamiento de Marisa sin dudas! me ha encantado! Está muy bien ubicado...cerca de todo! principalmente del coliseo. Está cerca de una zona con bares donde se come rico y a buen precio!... excelente relación precio calidad ....nos atendió personalmente el esposo de Marisa, el señor Remo, que nos ayudó con todo lo que le preguntamos, nos dió datos del transporte, súper amable y atento. Marisa me respondió los mensajes rápido y solucionó mis inquietudes al instante. El desayuno que incluye es seco pero está muy bien! Fueron muy buenos ya que me dejaron dejar las valijas antes del check in y después del check out sin cobrarme nada extra! Nada de qué quejarme! Estuvo excelente!;9
256;26;2022-11-07;288;camera con bagno privato di piccole dimensioni ma con tutto il necessario per un bel soggiorno.;10
257;26;2022-11-10;289;La habitación es sencilla y muy práctica. Todo lo que necesitas para una breve estancia. No conocimos a Marisa, pero sí al marido, Remo, un encanto de persona. El edificio donde está la habitación tiene muchísima historia que él te contará con lujo de detalles. Estarás a 200 metros del Coliseo y puedes ir andando a prácticamente todas las atracciones turísticas. Sin duda muy recomendable.;10
258;26;2022-11-13;290;La ubicación es espectacular! La habitación estaba súper limpia y era cómoda. Los anfitriones fueron muy amables, muchas gracias!;9
259;26;2022-11-16;291;es una habitación muy antigua, la Cama es muy incómoda y no tuve agua caliente un día. Todo lo demás bien, nos llevaron el desayuno los días que estuvimos hospedados.;10
260;26;2022-11-20;292;The room is very well located, 1 minute walking to Colisseum, and many other main sites you can easily can get there by walking tour. Also, plenty bars and restaurant nearby. The room was very clean, tidy and the attention was good, the communication for check-in and check-out. I absolutely would stay here again on my next visit to Rome, many thanks Marisa!;10
261;27;2022-10-29;293;Giorgio’s apartment was in a prime location, we couldn’t have asked for better. Only knock is that it is extremely loud at night but that is something we expected due to the reviews. If you can handle sleeping through a ton of traffic and loud voices then you should definitely book here as the access to all the sites you want to see is unbeatable. Giorgio was very kind and easy to communicate with throughout the stay and was very helpful. Thanks Giorgio!;8
262;27;2022-11-05;294;Emplacement idéal de l’appartement. Giorgio fait le nécessaire pour répondre aux attentes de ses hôtes.;10
263;27;2022-11-11;295;L'emplacement est idéal. Appartement très propre et Giorgio répond très vite aux messages. Je conseille!;10
264;27;2022-11-21;296;We had a great stay right next to the Pantheon, it was a great home base and made it very easy to explore Rome! We enjoyed the pizza and gelato within walking distance and appreciated the umbrellas since it did rain a little during our trip.;9
265;27;2022-11-28;297;Giorgio was absolutely a Super Host! He was very responsive before & during our stay: he provided delightful restaurant recommendations, made check-in super easy, & even came over within 30 minutes (in the rain) to help when we couldn’t figure something out in the apartment. He was flexible & accommodating on check-in & out. We found the location to be absolutely perfect - it is easy/moderate walking distance to all the sites we wanted to see. Very charming neighborhood. The apartment itself was very clean & spacious (other than the shower). Everything looked recently renovated. While this was generally a wonderful stay, this is an old apartment building in a historic city, which comes with a few very real drawbacks. The pedestrian/traffic noise on the street is very loud all through the night & carries into the apartment, which is not at all soundproof. Also, the bathroom had a very unfortunate sewage odor during our stay (maybe due to the rain?).;10
266;27;2022-12-02;298;we had a great stay at giorgio’s airbnb, clean and comfy. Will definitely book again when we come back to Rome, he also responded very quickly upon our arrival;10
267;27;2022-12-10;299;Apartamento perfecto para familia, ubicación inmejorable.;7
268;28;2022-05-20;300;Belsiana St. was a perfect location for our family of 5 including 3 adult children. The location allowed us to walk everywhere (although we did log about 8 miles on our tour of the Vatican and Garibaldi Park) and there was no shortage of restaurants, cafes ,shopping whatever you need within a few blocks. Safe area, clean apartment, comfortable bed, clean baths. Great value.;9
269;28;2022-05-22;301;Everything was perfect from start to finish. The flat is brilliantly located, clean and super comfortable. Mirca was greatly helpful with everything, making sure we were having the best time. Definitely coming back to beautiful Rome!;10
270;28;2022-05-23;302;This place was absolutely beautiful. The interior was amazing and the location could not be better. Wish we spent more time there! The owner was super responsive and also helped with transport to the airport!;10
271;28;2022-05-25;303;Merveilleux séjour Mirca est une excellente hote;8
272;28;2022-05-28;304;Wonderful place, highly to recommend (location, quiet apartment, comfortable beds, great communication);10
273;28;2022-06-02;305;Mirca was a FABULOUS host . I could go on and on about her on this review. From the beginning her communication and attention to detail was outstanding . She not only arranged transport for us from the airport to her place but also helped us arrange transportation when we got off our cruise a week later . She went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. It made a huge difference in my experience. The apartment has perfect location, so close to everything . We could walk to get lunch , gelato or pastry . Also 4 minutes from Metro and Spanish Steps. It is beautiful and comfortable . Mirca had friends meet us to help us with luggage and then she herself helped bring them down when we checked out . One morning she even surprised us with pastries ! She truly felt like a friend to us . Book this apartment !! You WONT be disappointed.;9
274;28;2022-06-05;306;The location is perfect. Hard to better it. The apartment is huge - twice the size of an average two bed place. Great for families or groups. We enjoyed the stay and would highly recommend.;10
275;28;2022-06-10;307;This apartment is unbelievable. So large and comfortable and in a perfect location. You can walk to almost all of the big sites and it is close to a metro station if walking isn’t your thing. I feel very lucky to have chosen this property for our stay. Mirca is an excellent host and I will recommend this place for anyone I know who wants to visit Rome.;9
276;28;2022-06-13;308;I'm not sure we've ever stayed in a more beautiful AirBnB. It was so lovely that we've literally asked if the owners would be interested in selling! The rooms were spacious, the beds and pillows were very comfortable, having an extra 1/2 bath was so helpful with 6 people. The living room was comfortable, the kitchen is a decent size, and it is just truly a beautiful space. We loved our time there and can't wait to rent this flat again!;10
277;28;2022-06-16;309;Beautiful apartment in the best location. Clean, comfortable, great location. Mirca helped us with our bags since we arrived quote early. Easy communication. Will be back. Strongly recommend.;10
278;28;2022-06-18;310;Our stay was great! Awesome location, clean and comfortable, excellent communication. I will definitely recommend this to friends!;10
279;28;2022-06-19;311;Great location! Amazing restaurants right outside your door. Mirca was wonderful with setting up transportation from the airport to her place and to the cruise port. The place itself is so roomy and loved it! Would highly recommend!!;10
280;28;2022-06-21;312;Mirca was SO easy to work with! She answered all of our questions before and during our stay. The apartment is very spacious and super convenient to be able to walk most places. She also offered suggestions of where to grocery shop and get good pizza! We would absolutely stay here again!;10
281;28;2022-06-23;313;We enjoyed our stay at Mircas spacious apartment. We appreciated the extra effort on Mircas part as the washing machine was not working and she took our laundry to have it washed for us which was a huge help on our trip. The apartment was beautiful and convenient. Lovely!;10
282;28;2022-06-24;314;Great place;9
283;29;2022-11-12;315;The apartment was is a great location. Lots of restaurants and shopping and most attractions were walking distance or accessible by metro which was a 1 min walking distance. Giorgio was an excellent host and made getting to the apartment easy.;10
284;29;2022-11-13;316;Such a wonderful experience! The communication and graciousness of the host was exceptional. We’d highly recommend this place to anyone!;10
285;29;2022-11-19;317;Amazing place to stay! Giorgio was a perfect host - would visit again!;7
286;29;2022-11-21;318;Fantastically located near a metro station or walk to Trevi, Spanish Steps, and Pantheon. Inside is spacious and great for being a place to rest. A little noisy at night but most apartments on an urban street are. Giorgio was a great host and communicator.;10
287;29;2022-11-22;319;El lugar se encuentra en un lugar muy céntrico, la comunicación con Giorgio fue buena se preocupó desde el inicio.;8
288;29;2022-11-25;320;A really lovely apartment that easily sleeps 4 or 5 adults! A fab location and Giorgio was very helpful! Check in was easy and I’d love to stay here again.;10
289;29;2022-11-29;321;good location with very helpful host.;10
290;29;2022-12-06;322;Lovely location. Giorgio always supports us. I recommend it;9
291;29;2022-12-11;323;Posizione incredibile. Stupenda tra Via Veneto e piazza Bernini. Vicina a molte attrazioni, tipo fontana di Trevi, Quirinale, piazza di Spagna, teatro Sistina e tantissime altre. Appartamento non nuovissimo ma con tutti i comfort, ideale per 4 o 5 persone. Credo ritorneremo.;10
292;30;2022-04-18;324;The apartment has a great location, it's close to a busy street but the windows have good noise protection. There was black mold in the shower but I think you have to be ready to compromise when you get this location for cheap price. I would recommend the place but just keep this in mind.;10
293;30;2022-04-21;325;5min Fußweg vom Colosseum, super gelegen, viele Restaurants und Bars in der Nähe. Restaurant ubbten drunter bedeutet auch dementsprechend Lärm. Einfach aber sauber. 1 Punkt Abzug, Frühstück heisst Nescafé und Fertigcroissant aus der Tüte.;10
294;30;2022-04-22;326;Excellent location, clean and well stocked room. Host was very helpful with directions and recommendations. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a central place to stay.;10
295;30;2022-04-27;327;Beautiful accommodation in the city center. Communication with Marisa was quick and nice. The room was clean. I like it. Thank you for this vacation.;10

300;31;2022-11-14;332;Zona davvero molto tranquilla, a un passo dal raccordo e non lontana (quantomeno in auto) dai quartieri più centrali della città. Stanza ben tenuta e divano letto comodo. Il Sig. Giuseppe è gentilissimo e molto disponibile. Grazie!;10
301;31;2022-11-20;333;Host gentile e disponibile. Casa accogliente e pulita. Siamo molto soddisfatti!;10
302;31;2022-11-21;334;Camera pulita e accogliente. Pur avendo alloggiato per una sola notte, sono stato pienamente soddisfatto dei servizi offerti dalla stanza. Giuseppe è stato un host gentile e disponibile anche agli orari più improbabili e mi ha fornito consigli preziosi riguardo le linee atac utili in diversi orari. Se dovessi ricapitare in zona, sarei ben lieto di alloggiare nuovamente da lui.;10
303;31;2022-11-27;335;Tutto occhei grazie;7

305;32;2021-09-05;337;Bianca’s place is just soo amazing! I immediately felt like home, like it’s my apartment and I’m living in Rome. Very bright and spacious place with great kitchen equipped with everything you may need. Location is great, 1 minute from Colloseum. Wifi and everything works well! Highly recommend!✨;9
306;32;2021-09-06;338;Tidy and cute place by the Colosseum. Easy to check in and out. Perfect for my one night in Rome!;10
307;32;2021-09-07;339;Well! You go straight to the corner and right in front of you is the coliseum. Next to the building it’s a store where you can find food, drink. And near to the coliseum it’s a restaurant. Now talking about the apartment, it’s a dream. We don’t even wanted to go out of it. Super big bathroom. Pretty nice living area. Well equipment and beautiful 😻 it has so many details that i felt in love with that I’ll let you discover them by yourself. Supper recommended Bianca is super kind ✨;10
308;32;2021-09-09;340;Bianca’s apartment was very clean and well set up. Check in was very easy, she was very responsive. Location being so close to the colosseum was nice, and I was able to walk just about everywhere I wanted to go!;8
309;32;2021-09-12;341;Perfect!;10
310;32;2021-09-14;342;Bianca’s place was the perfect place to stay in Rome. Very close to the Coliseum, the Roman Forum, restaurants, cafes train, and many beautiful sites to see. The apartment design was simple elegance and every room was beautifully curated. Each room was plenty big and comfortable! Bianca was very helpful with recommendations and check in and out was a breeze. I highly recommend Bianca’s lovely home.;9
311;33;2022-10-07;343;Raphael was an excellent host. He reached out the day before my arrival to plan the check in time. His flat was clean, modern, and in an excellent location in the heart of the Trestavere neighborhood. When we left he helped us find a taxi to take us to the train station. Raphael went above and beyond, I highly recommend.;10
312;33;2022-10-13;344;Raphael met us and explained the neighbourhood and the apartment. Clean, well appointed in an interesting neighbourhood. Friends recommended this listing, I will recommend it also. When phone issues prevented contacting taxis, Raphael arranged our airport departure - above and beyond. Any questions were answered promptly. Very helpful with recommendations and websites. Thanks Raphael !!;8
313;33;2022-10-19;345;AMAZING! Raphael’s flat was so suited to our preferences. Every detail of his flat was meaningful and convenient. Located in such a wonderful area, it gives a visitor an opportunity to venture in so many directions with little effort. Communication was prompt and concise and I’d HIGHLY RECOMMEND this flat to anyone visiting Rome.;10
314;33;2022-10-21;346;Great place to stay! Very close to lots of great restaurants;10
315;33;2022-10-23;347;Great host and communication, cute apartment!;10
316;33;2022-10-26;348;Fantastic stay! Raphael was instant with communication and very accommodating of our check in time. The apartment is beautifully clean and comfortable with all amenities could ask for. Trastevere is a lovely part of Rome to stay in and easy to walk to all main sights.;9
317;33;2022-10-31;349;Raphael’s apartment is brilliant and so is he! Perfect location and an amazing apartment. Raphael was so helpful, even popping over himself to fix a door that came off it’s hinges. One of the best Airbnbs we ever stayed at. Also, next door to perhaps the world’s best cheese and delicatessen, Antica Caciara. Will stay here every time we visit Rome in the future. Thanks Raphael.;10
318;33;2022-11-05;350;Great apartment in a great location. Comfortable, safe and convenient. Trastevere is the best place to get a feeling for authentic Rome, and this apartment puts you in the middle of the community.;8
319;34;2022-10-27;351;Amazing location. Such a great district, full of character, with lots of local cafes and restaurants. So near to the Coliseum, it was perfect. We had a great trip.;10
320;34;2022-10-29;352;This place has it all. Incredible host who goes above and beyond to accommodate anything you need. The place is great with comfy beds, great patio to hangout on and everything you need. Really one of the places for host and place I’ve ever stayed at in an Airbnb.;10
321;34;2022-11-08;353;A great space for a family or for anyone who wants a special Italian experience. The Monti neighborhood is super cool.;7
322;34;2022-11-10;354;El lugar es muy bonito y bien ubicado, siempre hubo gran comunicación y todo se resolvió a tiempo y en forma. Sin duda recomiendo este espacio, la terraza es un gran plus y es muy espaciado. Espero volver pronto!!;9
323;34;2022-11-11;355;Excelente lugar, limpio y bonito. Solo hay que subir muchas muchas escaleras.;10
324;34;2022-11-18;356;Great spot right near the colosseum with lots to do nearby;10
325;35;2022-11-20;357;Ha estado todo muy buen apartamento muy limpio y todo muy cómodo sin contar que está muy cerca de las mayorías de los monumentos principales y se puede ir a pie sin mucho problema, de nuevo muchas gracias Manuel por todo.;9
326;35;2022-11-24;358;we had an excellent stay in Manuel's flat! great location and Manuel was easy to reach at all times and gave great sight seeing tips!;10
327;35;2022-11-26;359;Ottimo e consigliatissimo. Manuel disponibilissimo, ti fa sentire a casa. Ovviamente con una scala interna non è per tutti. Ambiente perfetto, pulito spazioso, molto silenzioso per essere a Roma, le mura molto spesse sicuramente contribuiscono.;10
328;35;2022-11-27;360;Manuel was an amazing host, and made my trip to rome 100x better. Thank you Manuel!;10
329;35;2022-11-28;361;Centrally located, only a 10 minute walk from the Termini station, very clean for an old building, great tasting tap water, and the host was gracious and helpful. We appreciated his attention and we knew he was always reachable by phone.;10
330;35;2022-11-30;362;Thoroughly enjoyed my stay, close to everything i wanted to see and close to main streets;8
331;35;2022-12-01;363;This is a really nice place to stay, it’s big and has an upstairs with 2 bathrooms which is rare from what I’ve seen. Ground floor, so easy with luggage. It’s not far from the train station. It’s in a busy location so was a bit loud but not so bad. It’s well stocked and there’s a lot of thought put into the details. Manuel was really helpful at check in!;10
332;35;2022-12-04;364;Great place, location is in an alley with not a ton near it though. Although walking distance to major locations;10
333;36;2022-10-11;365;Lovely stay, very easy to get around and Federica was very helpful!;9
334;36;2022-10-14;366;Great clean and minimalist apartment. As you read the reviews, there are 72 steps to get to the apartment. No problem for us but it could be challenging. We also had carry on luggage only. Host was very gracious to let us place our luggage in the apartment earlier so we can start our tour of Rome. Lots of great restaurants near by. A good grocery store for wine and snacks.;10
335;36;2022-10-17;367;Federica was amazing. Swift responses great location and helpful. I left my necklace and they recovered it and sent it back to my in NY. Best hosts ever!;10
336;36;2022-10-20;368;The stay was so good, I think it’s probably perfect place to stay in Rome, Would love to come back here 6/5 :);7
337;36;2022-10-27;369;Appartement propre et bien équipé . Frederica Maria est un hôte disponible et agréable , elle nous a permis de laisser nos bagages plus tôt que prévu . Appartement bien placé par rapport aux monuments , surtout le Vatican qui est juste à côté . Très jolie terrasse sur le toit avec une vue magnifique sur le toit de La Chapelle Sixtine . On a passé un agréable séjour à Rome ! Je recommande cet appartement .;10
338;36;2022-10-30;370;Bright, clean and spacious apartment in a period block in a great neighbourhood with excellent bus and train links. Two small supermarkets are very close by, along with great pizzarias, bars and cafes. Also really well placed for the Vatican (a short walk away) and other key attractions. Federica offered an easy check-in and communicated with us throughout our stay to check if we needed anything. We would happily stay again!;8
339;36;2022-10-31;371;Friendly, responsive host, good apartment ☺️;10
340;36;2022-11-06;372;A great place for a first visit in Rome!;10
341;37;2022-10-19;373;Beautiful place, Nice location, 5/5;9
342;37;2022-10-21;374;Mi sono trovata bene. A due passi dalla stazione Termini per cui comodissima. Stanza pulita e curata nei dettagli. Bagno piccolo ma funzionale.;10
343;37;2022-10-26;375;Great place but there was lack of communication with the host when I needed to ask some things;9
344;37;2022-10-27;376;¡La mejor experiencia! Maria fue muy atenta, muy gentil, nos apoyó en todo momento y siempre muy respetuosa. Habla español por lo que se le facilitó mucho indicarnos todo con lujo de detalle. lugares para comer, precauciones, lugares, etc. Chiara estuvo muy atenta desde el primer día que reservé, siempre esta en constante comunicación y siempre al pendiente para dar dar todos los detalles. El departamento está muy bien, excelente ubicación a 3 min a pie de término, alrededor harmonio restaurantes. Bares, buses. ¡Indudablemente regresaría!;10
345;37;2022-11-02;377;The hosts were very accommodating and the location of the property is great for connectivity to public transport.;10
346;37;2022-11-02;378;Excelente;10
347;37;2022-11-04;379;Cleaning is not bad but the most important problem was bed was so old and uncomfortable;10
348;38;2022-11-13;380;Amazing location. Very sweet, cozy place with all the space we needed. For a walking city, this place was a perfect location to rest up after a long day.;9
349;38;2022-11-19;381;Ideal for a couple, near everything by walking distance 5 - 20 minutes.;8
350;38;2022-11-22;382;El espacio, la ubicación y cada detalle decorativo es minuciosamente elegido. Todo el apartamento está perfectamente dotado para tener una estancia cómoda y funcional. El proceso de checkin y checkout es sencillo y Stefania responde en el acto las preguntas y las dudas. Nos ayudaron con la limpieza para ingresar más rápido. 10 de 10 a este lugar que nos dejó la mejor impresión de Roma. Volvería sin duda!;10
351;38;2022-11-24;383;The best host i ever had!! The place is beautiful. Totally recommend it.;10
352;38;2022-12-05;384;Bellisimo departamento, con todos los detalles necesarios, espectacular ubicacion en pleno centro historico, salir a la calle y ya estar ahi, con restaurantes a metros. Muy cerca de la Piazza Navona, un lujo. Stefania nos dio instrucciones claras y precisas para el check in, nos ha recibido con atenciones de toda clase, super completo para el desayuno y accesorios. Super atenta en todo, me ha ayudado en un inconveniente personal, estando siempre a disposicion. MUY RECOMENDABLE.;10
353;38;2022-12-09;385;Stefania has a wonderful place, just the right size for the two of us and it has everything you can think of, we even cooked a meal on our last evening And my husband enjoyed the complementary bottle of red wine ( a lovely touch-also all the sweets) , However the apartment is very close some great restaurants if you want to stay near but walking distance if you wanted further out, also walking distance to all the well known attractions, if you didn’t fancy walking there is a taxi rank just around the corner. Absolutely fantastic stay, would definitely stay again 😊;7
354;38;2022-12-11;386;We highly recommend staying at Stefanias place when in Rome. As a host she is going above and beyond to make your stay as comfortable as possible.;10
355;39;2022-11-14;387;I had a lovely and personised stay at the Villa Letizia Felt very welcomed by the Nuns and found the atmosphere peaceful;9
356;39;2022-11-16;388;excelente, lugar limpio y con buena atención, la ubicación también me gustó, fue muy tranquila mi noche en este hotel y no me hizo falta nada. aunque no tenía calefacción no me dio frío porque tienen suficientes cobijas;10
357;39;2022-11-17;389;Du wirst sehr nett begrüßt und alles ist topp , Zimmer für den preis auch top , nichts für feine Damen aber für den preis super !;10
358;39;2022-11-17;390;Great stay!;8
359;39;2022-11-18;391;Fue sorpresa que estuviese a cargo de religiosas ya que tengo una hermana al servicio de la iglesia también;10
360;39;2022-11-21;392;Rapporto qualità prezzo conveniente, un po distante dal centro ma comunque sulla via Aurelia. Pulizia e prima colazione tra buono e ottimo;10
361;39;2022-11-23;393;Great place to stay if you want a quiet no fuss night. 30min from Rome city so have to take bus and train to get in. Very Catholic cultured so be prepared if you’re uncomfortable with that. Otherwise good breakfast and lovely hosts;9
362;40;2022-02-04;394;Nagyon szép apartman, minden nagyobb látványosság elérhető gyalog is , nagyon jó helyen van, éttermek , supermarketek pár percre vannak. Az apartman tiszta jól felszerelt. Mire megérkeztünk szépen ki volt takarítva , volt bekészítve ásványvíz, kávé , tea 🙂 a pezsgőfürdő nagyon super van hozzá hangulatvilágítás . Nagyon romantikus igazi római lakás.nekünk nagyon tetszett ha legközelebb Rómában járunk megint ide jövünk , köszönjük ezt a felejthetetlen élményt.🙂;10
363;40;2022-02-13;395;Es genial!;10
364;40;2022-02-16;396;L’appartement est exactement comme sur les photos😍 Il est très bien localisé et permet de faire beaucoup de choses à pied. Je reviendrais sans hésiter !!!;7
365;40;2022-02-17;397;Very good room and Rome is a place to be once in a life;10
366;40;2022-02-18;398;Tutto perfetto dalla stanza alla comunicazione con l’host. Grande disponibilità.;9
367;40;2022-02-19;399;Appartamento nuovo e ben arredato, posizione ottima e dotata di tutti comfort necessari. Federica è un host molto gentile e disponibile.;10
368;40;2022-02-25;400;comfortable place in close walking proximity to everything. enjoyed our stay;10
369;41;2022-05-02;401;Sergio's apartment is an excellent stay for anyone spending time in Rome! My girlfriend and I stayed with him for 2 nights and it was a great place to rest after long days of seeing the sights. The room and whole apartment was very clean. In addition, the location is perfect for catching a short bus ride to whatever attraction you want to see or wherever you need to go! Sergio was an excellent host on top of this. He was super accommodating to us and our ever changing arrival plans. He is very friendly and has tons of info in the form of suggestions and pamphlets on a table in the room for helping to make plans. We loved staying here and couldn't recommend it highly enough!;8
370;41;2022-05-04;402;el mejor lugar en el que pude descanzar, todo cerca y muy buena vista excelente;10
371;41;2022-05-06;403;Great stay, very nice quarter, easy to find and the center can even be reached by a nice stroll by the river.;10
372;41;2022-05-10;404;Sergio is absolutely the best Airbnb host we have ever had. (Not exaggerating!!) He is kind, flexible, accommodating, and great company. He takes great care of you and loves to give great recommendations, especially about food! The room is spacious and perfect for storage and sleeping. It has a great location, close enough to the center of the city to travel, and far enough to get a taste of the local Italian lifestyle. We loved our time here!;10
373;41;2022-05-15;405;Es un lugar perfecto para conocer Roma, está muy próximo al centro de la ciudad donde puedes llegar fácilmente en bus o metro, la comunicación con Sergio fue excelente siempre atento a ayudarnos durante nuestra estancia.;9
374;41;2022-05-16;406;queda muy cerca de varias paradas de autobuses y lugares turísticos;10
375;41;2022-05-20;407;Sergio’s place is as described with the room being very spacious and clean in there. Sergio was very communicative and accessible whenever we needed anything. The metro is also only a 20 minute walk away so the location is also good. The only downfall was perhaps the kitchen, it was dirty and we couldn’t use it straight away after we checked it but it was mangeable if you don’t plan on cooking a lot. Additionally, if you plan on doing alot of clothes washing there is an additional fee that we didn’t know about but it might now be on the listing.;10
376;42;2022-05-25;408;appartement parfait. très bon emplacement, proche du centre de Rome. propre. joliment décoré. hôte très accueillante et reactive. je recommande vivement.;10
377;42;2022-05-28;409;Great place in a good location (and right next to police station so we felt really safe). Host was nice and helpful;8
378;42;2022-05-29;410;you are looking for a place in Rome, do not look any further. Orsetta and her flat are amazing. You are situated in a quiet street in front of the police station. The building is so lovely with amazing features like the grand staircase and old fashion lift, however she completely redesigned the inside and it is modern and well appointed. Immaculate rooms and bathrooms, lovely kitchen for breakfast you can use as well with everything you need. The most amazing thing is that you are about 10 mns from Trevi Fountain, 15 for the collyseum and 10 from Termini Station. She is so so helpful and greeted us at arrival and knew our flight was late! She also took time to explain everything and her efficiency on the Airbnb message app is incredible! She is also incredibly honest as we forgot something in the room and offered to put it in the side or send it back home. Thank you again for your kindness and amazing flat. We will definitely book again next time we are in Rome, kind regards Nadège;10
379;42;2022-06-02;411;Perfect clean apartment with so much room, really good location and really lovely owner will definitely be back!;7
380;42;2022-06-03;412;Orsetta’s place is situated in an amazing location - walking distances from all the main monuments. We only stayed one night but managed to see the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Pantheon, Colosseum - all by foot! The room itself was big and spacious and situated on a quiet and peaceful street so we had no issues with falling asleep. Orsetta was also extremely accomodating and responsive.;9
381;42;2022-06-07;413;Very quiet and clean , really central located appartement. Very good communication with Orsetta who shares good restaurant recommendations. Nice spot to stay for different days! We visited everything on foot from the appartement;10
382;42;2022-06-11;414;Ottima scelta Posizione eccellente Accoglienza e disponibilità perfette;10
383;42;2022-06-17;415;Orsetta was a great host. Always replied quickly and provided anything we needed. Accommodation was very clean, spacious and within walking distance of all landmarks and train station.;8
384;42;2022-06-19;416;Great location!;10
385;43;2022-10-14;417;Location is excellent. You can reach all the tourist location easily.;10
386;43;2022-10-16;418;It was my second time staying here and I was just as pleased as the first time. Great location, lovely front end team and great value for what you’re paying.;9
387;43;2022-11-01;419;Cumplió con creces nuestras expectativas, el lugar esta muy bien ubicado, a 10 min caminando del terminal y 10 min caminando del coliseo, el recinto es seguro, la habitación limpia, internet rápido y la comunicación con anfitrion fluida. Fueron muy amables al ajustar el chek-in.;10
388;43;2022-11-03;420;Todo bien, el baño amplio y la habitación muy cómoda.;10
389;43;2022-11-06;421;Hotel in buona posizione, a metà tra Colosseo e stazione Termini, molto pulito e camera spaziosa per due persone. Peccato solo per il bagno che ogni tanto tirando lo sciacquone schizzava acqua dal serbatoio. Accoglienza gentilissima e disponibile, ottima comunicazione con il gestore.;10
390;43;2022-11-19;422;cazarea se afla la 15 minute mers pe jos de Colosseum. Recomand si restaurantul de vis-a-vis de hotel. camera micuta, dar curata.;8
391;43;2022-11-29;423;Nice place I was satisfied wth my stay 😁;10
392;43;2022-12-04;424;Baño muy viejo, deteriorado y con muy malos olores. Necesita reforma urgente. Por lo demás, aceptable.;10
393;44;2022-10-14;425;It was a great stay for 4 of us, the beds were comfortable, the Location was just perfect, on the main road, supermarket at 100m, lots of shops to eat and drink. Bus stop just in front of the property. Vatican city is just 1,2 km away.;9
394;44;2022-10-16;426;Daniele è gentilissimo è super flessibile su orari e modalità di check in! L’appartamento non è in una posizione centrale ma strategico per collegarsi a tutto con i mezzi. 10-15min a piedi da piazza san Pietro. Appartamento pulitissimo, comodo e funzionalmente ben arredato. Torneremo sicuramente!;10
395;44;2022-10-21;427;I cannot recommend this apartment enough! It is perfect for solo travellers or couples. The apartment was impeccably clean. It is in such a great location: close to both thebus and metro, but also within walking distance of all of the main sites. When we arrived we were welcomed like old friends and truly felt like we were appreciated by the host as guests in her home. Will 100% be booking when we visit Rome again. 5 stars;10
396;44;2022-10-23;428;Appartamentino carino ed accogliente. Daniele e sua moglie gentili ed ospitali.;9
397;44;2022-10-25;429;Daniele siempre dispuesta a la comunicación, el lugar es tal cual las fotos, es una zona segura y comercial. Restaurantes cercas y tranquilo.;7
398;44;2022-11-04;430;We enjoyed our stay at Daniele’s. He was really nice and accommodated our delayed check in nicely. We found the place nice and clean. Super friendly and lovely folks. All in all, a good host and very understanding so a 5 star from me.;8
399;44;2022-11-06;431;Daniele sua moglie due host molto gentili e disponibili. La stanza è esattamente come in foto. La posizione è vicina a Piazza San Pietro e alla metro per raggiungere le posizioni più centrali.;10
400;44;2022-11-08;432;We had a great day-- the apartment was clean and self check-in was a breeze. Daniele was excellent with communication and even helped a set of a taxi from the airport. One convenient bus to the Vatican City, or a quick transfer to the Colliseum. Would definitely stay there again.;9
401;44;2022-11-11;433;This place was perfect. Super convenient location, incredibly clean and lots of space. Perfect for a couple! 🤗;7
402;44;2022-11-13;434;Siamo stati benissimo , appartamento piccolo e molto accogliente , posizione ottima per spostarsi con il pulman che funzionano con una precisione Svizzera, all'arrivo ci ha accolto credo la moglie di Daniele molto gentile e simpatica .. consiglio a tutti questo appartamentino delizioso;8

404;44;2022-11-20;436;The airbnb is situated in a great location. It is clean and very cosy, exactly as described. The host was very helpful throughout all the stay. I recommend this airbnb if you’re planning to stay in Rome :).;10
405;45;2018-04-10;163;I had such a great stay at 'the studio.' Francesca and Alberto are terrific hosts...not only did they provide maps with great suggestions of places and things to see, their warmth and friendly nature really made me feel at home in their place. Their home is right off one of the above ground trams that leads to the duome in like 12 minutes! I would highly recommend this place!;10
406;45;2018-04-16;164;Staying at Francesca's and Alberto's place was a pleasure. Just as described, well located for my purposes, an enjoyable walk to the Tortona area. The room is very nice, cleaned daily and has private bathroom.;9
407;45;2018-04-22;165;"This is my second time staying with Francesca and her family; as last year, it was a perfect stay. The perfect combination of hospitality and privacy :) ";10
408;45;2019-04-11;325;Ein wunderbares Zimmer mit privatem Bad/ WC, alles sehr schön, sauber und ruhig. Guter Tramanschluss direkt zum Duomo (ca. 20min);9
409;45;2019-04-14;166;"I was lucky so I have stayed with Francesca, Andrea and their petite son Pietro, they are very warm, helpfull and possitive and very intellectual family; I can say as they were like your family; everyday they're calling that you need something, advices, adreses, transportation..! But I will not forget every morning the breakfast was ready with all smilly and happy athmospher: wih fresh orange juice and homemade jam.:) The house is bigger then picture, very comfortable, full of day light, big bathroom with bathtube, when you are at home you feel very relax, comfortable..Out of home area is safty at midnight..To reach to Douma and Via Manzoni is very easy by tram that pass front of next three appartments, I was going to Furniture Fiera at Rho,it was easy without traffic..Francesca and Andrea are very opened mind couple, helpfull, exellent guide also for Milano; I advice and recommende to other people...";9
410;45;2019-04-17;167;Always a pleasure staying with Francesca and family. It's been a few years now that I head to Milan for my annual visit, and I stay there because I feel very much at home! I look forward to my next visit!;8
411;45;2019-09-18;404;The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.;0
412;45;2020-04-16;165;Another nice stay at Francesca's place.. I feel like one of the family! ;9
413;45;2021-04-08;166;"I've been staying at Francesca and Alberto's place for some years; it's like a second home in Milano!";10
414;45;2021-09-20;403;The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.;0
415;45;2022-04-21;167;Francesca and Alberto are like family now! Another great year with them.;10
416;45;2023-04-03;168;"Francesca is a perfect host; I have been staying with her family annually for a few years – I feel very much at home!";9
417;46;2018-04-24;410;We came to Milan for the Salone and had a fantastic time! Great location, close to the metro and lots of cafes and Zona Tortona. Comfortable sleeping accommodations and enough amenities for our use.;10
418;46;2018-09-21;414;La zona è molto comoda e la via è tranquilla. La palazzina è una tipica casa a ringhiera. La casa è quella in cui Jeremy abita. Richiederebbe quindi qualche adattamento per poter essere meglio fruibile (biancheria da rinnovare, spazi per i vestiti). Jeremy è comunque molto disponibile.;10
419;46;2019-04-16;404;Great apartment, clean and well equipped, great location, in a young and lively area. We had a great time!;8
420;46;2019-07-30;362;L'appartement de Jérémy est idéal pour séjourner à Milan quelques temps ! ;10
421;46;2019-08-22;436;A first: Jeremy is an excellent and helpfull host. The flat - nearby to Downtown Milano - is beautyful - we missed nothing. We spent a great time in Milano and (perhaps) we will come back in the future. Thanks a lot, Jermey!;10
422;46;2019-09-26;80;Jérémy est un hôte à recommander, il est très facilement joignable et de très bon conseil. Rien à redire, nous sommes entièrement satisfaits et avons passés un superbe séjour. L'appartement est charmant, propre, fonctionnel et bien situé. Un grand merci à Jérémy et Eva.;10
423;46;2020-01-01;424;Jeremy no estuvo en nuestra recepción, estaba de vacaciones, pero nos atendió vía telf y mail en todo momento. La casa estaba limpia y muy equipada. La única observación es que hacía algo de frío en la casa a pesar de tener calefacción y el agua caliente no funcionó en la ducha, pero Jeremy nos dijo que no era nada habitual. Un detalle de Jeremy es que nos dejó hacer un late late late check out al ser año nuevo. gracias! estamos muy agradecidas. ;9
424;46;2020-02-26;435;The apartment was nice and well furnished. Overall cleanliness was okay but it could have been better. Bed linen and towels were clean. The courtyard is very charming. We didn't feel super safe in the neighborhood at night, we went out for dinner with my friends around 9pm and a group of guys were quite rude to us. Not close to city center but not a problem if you have a car. ;10
425;46;2020-04-13;433;It's a very nice place which decorated well by Jeremy. He was proactive to arrange the check in and very kind to us. Thanks! ;10
426;46;2020-06-17;432;Jeremy was very communicative and has a great apartment in the most beautiful area of Milan;8
427;46;2020-08-07;418;We stayed at Jeremy's place for about a month and found it to be a perfect home for a long stay. Its a great place for younger people and couples looking for a more genuine experience of living in Milan. The street is a little seedy but never unsafe (just be aware of your surroundings and don't look like a tourist), and it is SO close to Navigli, which was a really fun neighborhood to explore. It's also 5 minutes away from the metro station which was really helpful for seeing the rest of the city. His flat is comfortable and very homey. The only thing missing was a strong air conditioner since we stayed in the middle of Summer. The home and street felt very authentic and not touristy at all. Jeremy and his Bnb sitter were very helpful and accommodating. My friend left her phone in the flat and Jeremy even agreed to ship it back to the U.S. for us! ;10
428;46;2021-04-22;423;Jeremy is amazing host! He has superior flat at very stylish district. We were glad to be there and we are recommend Jeremy as a good host and his flat like a best place who want having a good days in Milan.;10
429;46;2021-07-31;425;Jeremy is a nice host. Thoughtful and responsive in communication. The apartment is well equipped and located in a very convenient location with easy access to bars and coffee shops. We really enjoyed our stay.;10
430;46;2021-09-02;427;Jeremy's place is really great! If you want to experience true Milan you must stay here! It is very close to Naviglio Grand and the location is also great! Loved the flat and the stay was amazing!;10
431;46;2021-09-07;430;Very convenient location, close to Bocconi and the bars & restaurants in Navigli. The apartment is very large, with a great kitchen and bathroom. Comfortable bed. Terrific host, he was very accommodating & helpful with travel tips and advice.;10
432;46;2021-10-25;94;Le logement de Jeremy est très bien situé, un peu en retrait des rues très animées du quartier de Navigli. Le logement est conforme aux photos. Même si Jeremy n’était pas présent pour nous accueillir, sa disponibilité par message et son ami Alessandro nous ont permis d’accéder facilement à l’appartement. Grâce aux bons plans de notre hôte, nous avons apprécié découvrir Milan en vélo avec l’application BikeMi, que nous conseillons. À presto forse !;9
433;46;2022-01-01;431;Posizione ottima, in pieno centro Casa ben pulita e confortevole;8
434;46;2022-04-18;300;Perfect;10
435;46;2022-06-07;301;We had a wonderful stay ! It was clean, cosy, comfy and well located. I’ll recommand this airbnb for sure !;10
436;46;2022-06-10;361;Jeremy était absent de Milan mais il était disponible rapidement par téléphone;10
437;46;2022-07-12;428;Jeremy molto disponibile, l’appartamento penso sia il suo personale dove vive. Molto bello e carino, in ottima posizione sebbene inizialmente si sia presentato non pulitissimo. Abbiamo soggiornato ad inizio luglio e abbiamo sofferto molto il caldo non essendoci l’aria condizionata. Rapporto qualità prezzo molto buono. Dispiace solo di aver forse lasciato una pianta troppo secca per il caldo. A presto e grazie;10
438;46;2022-07-23;417;"Jeremy's flat was a perfect home for a week involving some remote work; comfortable, with a wonderfully well-equipped kitchen and wifi that was sufficient for a handful of Zoom meetings. It's tucked away but easily walkable to the Navigli district, and Jeremy was easy to get ahold of when necessary. Very happy to have stayed there!";10
439;47;2018-09-14;416;I have stayed in the rented room in the apartment for one week because of work arrangements. It was a very nice, clean place, easy to get to and very close and with direct transport for the main touristic sites of the city. Giancarlo was very helpful with advice about the orientation around in the district and for the nice restaurants nearby. If I have another chance to visit Milan, I would gladly stay there again.;9
440;47;2018-09-25;415;We had a wonderful time at this place in Milan. The apartment is located within walking distance of everything Milan has to offer. And the host was very helpfull;10
441;47;2019-01-20;413;The reservation was canceled 77 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.;10
442;47;2019-10-06;412;I had a wonderful experience staying at Giancarlo's flat. He was the perfect host,incredibly polite, welcoming, helpful in many ways. The room was really tidy and clean, very species, bright and comfortable. The neighbourhood is beautiful, close to everything in the centre of Milan. I highly recommend this accommodation to everyone.;8
443;47;2019-10-21;426;Giancarlo è una persona gentile e disponibile, mi ha dato tutte le informazioni per raggiungere l'appartamento velocemente. Posizione ottima per raggiungere il centro anche a piedi. La camera e il bagno erano puliti ma mi aspettavo maggiore confort, riscaldamenti ancora spenti con 17 gradi e struttura del bagno molto usurata! ;10
444;47;2019-10-27;411;Giancarlo was a great host. Came to pick me up at Milan central station, gave me a map of the city, swapped my room with a bigger one which also has a private bathroom and even invited me and my friends for a 3am spaghetti feast on the second night of my stay. ;10
445;47;2020-03-17;429;La ubicación es excelente , los taxistas siempre sabian a donde ir. ;10
446;47;2020-03-23;410;I was sooo lucky to have Giancarlo as my first ever AIRBNB host, he is so organized and considerate, I was already impressed by his big smile, warm greetings and sincerety the moment I arrived at his apartment. He always tried his best to find answers to my questions and solutions to my problems, my stay in Milan was really smooth and pleasant thanks to Giancarlo's help. On the day I left Milan, he drove me very early in the morning all the way to the entrance of Milano Centrale, helping me with the heavy luggage, giving some tips, I really felt pretty grateful. Also, the apartment itself is comfortable and clean, everything is literally within walking distance. I definitely would recommend Giancarlo and his apartment to all AIRBNB users, you won't be disappointed. Thank you Giancarlo, for hosting me, as well as the homemade cake and cookies! Hope to see you again someday!;7
447;47;2020-04-07;409;Giancarlo was the perfect host. Considerate, informative and welcoming. Picked up and dropped off at the airport. Made me feel at ease and made a high energy business trip as relaxing as possible. Will book again next year- if available...;10
448;47;2020-05-03;408;I stayed for 7 nights in the studio. It is exactly same as you can see from the pictures, very clean and comfortable. The location is perfect, within walking distance to everywhere in the city. I was 'working from home' for 4 days. It was quiet while wifi was good. I actually need to share the bathroom with Giancarlo but didn't feel any inconvenience. Giancarlo is a very polite, organised, helpful and respectful host. The massage (on charge 😊) delivered to room is a surprising bonus! Overall it was a very pleasant stay, my second visit to Milano and also my second experience with Airbnb. Glad I made it all right. ;8
449;47;2020-05-16;407;Giancarlo it was a great time exploring Milano from your place! The place was awesome and I enjoyed my stay at your home! Thank you for hosting me and I hope to visit again soon! Giancarlo's home was perfect for visiting Milano and easy to get around and he helped with any questions! I would definitely suggest his place to stay at while visiting!;10

454;47;2021-01-02;410;Here comes the 5-stars feedback! I experienced an amazing hospitality from Giancarlo! He is always reachable and responds quickly. His tips on how and where to go made my first time in Milan very enjoyable! The location is superb: I didn’t even need to use a public transportation to move around. Few more things: Not only did I got upgraded for a better room for few days I genuinely enjoyed the delicious surprise of an ultra healthy home made New Year’s cake! It was a sweet gesture :) I’d definitely recommend him to everyone!;10
455;47;2021-02-21;411;Had a very nice stay!;10

457;47;2021-04-22;413;Giancarlo is a perfect host: punctual, organized, friendly, discreet and very kind! The apartment is very clean and the location is fabulous. It is close to the Red Line subway and very close to the Duomo. It's cozy and I felt right at home. On the street there are supermarket and restaurants and delicious bakeries. In addition, Giancarlo gives tips on places to dine and is always on hand. Very attentive! I will certainly point you out and I will come back at a next opportunity!;10
458;47;2022-02-22;414;Great staying and Giancarlo was super nice!!;10

463;48;2022-04-18;419;Riccardo was a great attentive host. Even before our trip, he communicated with us often to make sure we were adequately prepared. He met us at the apartment, which by the way, was wonderful and cozy, and showed us everything we needed to know. He even had a bottle of champagne for us! The apartment's location is great - its next to an M1 train stop, which should get you where you need to go around the city. Riccardo checked in everyday to make sure we were doing okay, so that was very nice. Would stay again, so can't recommend this enough to others. Only minor issue We had was some neighborhood noise at late hours, but with the window shut it was resolved. ;9
464;48;2022-05-03;420;Riccardo was an excellent host! ;10
465;48;2022-06-14;421;Apartament jest usytuowana w bardzo dogodnej okolicy blisko do St. Centrale, metra w samym centrum miasta. Riccardo jest bardzo miłym i uczynnym gospodarzem.

466;48;2022-06-29;422;"La casa è molto accogliente, piacevole e pulita! Solo il balcone è più piccolino da come si vede nelle foto ma in due ci siamo stati comodi lo stesso. L'ubicazione dell' appartamento è perfetta; 10 minuti a piedi dalla stazione Centrale e la fermata M Lima à 20 Mt! Consiglio vivamente Riccardo che per altro è sempre stato disponibile e preciso nei nostri tre giorni Meneghini.";10
467;49;2022-03-26;423;Appartamento accogliente e ben posizionato, a due passi da corso Buenos Aires e da fermata metro/bus, comodo per raggiungere moltissimi punti di interesse in città. Simone è una persona molto disponibile, la comunicazione è stata ottima per tutta la durata del soggiorno.;10

475;49;2022-09-16;39;Tutto bene il soggiorno. L'appartamento è carino, ma se piove è una tragedia perché non si possono aprire le finestre essendo una mansarda. Da tenere presente;10
476;49;2022-09-22;40;Excelente todo, el anfitrión es el mejor;10
477;49;2022-09-24;41;Apartment, location, and host were all excellent. Metro and supermarket right outside the door. Top floor apartment was spacious, clean and nicely decorated - there's an elevator, then just a few stairs to reach the door. Communication and check-in were great. Simone is an outgoing and friendly host, eager and ready to help. Would stay again!;7
478;49;2022-09-26;42;Simone è un host estremamente disponibile, preciso e puntuale. L'attico è in un'ottima posizione (praticamente all'uscita della Metro), estremamente spazioso e silenzioso.;10

480;49;2022-10-02;44;Io e la mia ragazza siamo stati ospiti di Simone, ed è stata una delle migliori esperienze che abbiamo avuto. L'attico è spazioso, ben arredato e estremamente confortevole in ogni sua parte. La posizione è perfetta, letteralmente a fianco all'ingresso della metropolitana, immersa in qualunque servizio o negozio sia necessario. Simone è stato un host super gentile e simpatico, non ci ha fatto mancare niente e ci è venuto sempre incontro, nonostante il ritardo di diverse ore causato dagli aerei che ci portavano a Milano. Consigliatissimo, se dovesse esserci nuovamente la possibilità di andare a Milano cercheremo sicuramente di tornare.;9
481;49;2022-10-12;45;Appartamento molto spazioso in zona ben servita è piena di locali. Simone è un ottimo host e per qualsiasi cosa è disponibile . Mansarda dal gusto retrò quindi nonostante ci sia tutto non è detto che ci si trovi a proprio agio per via delle altezze e tipologia di arredamento .;10
482;49;2022-10-16;46;Really good location if you want to be near the subway and the city centre. The appartment is not new but very comfortable. Simone and his wife are allways willing to help if it is needed.;10
483;49;2022-11-07;47;Posto fantastico, design bellissimo, attrezzato adeguatamente, e collegato benissimo con i mezzi pubblici. Simone e la sua famiglia sono delle persone meravigliose. E stato un bellissimo incontro! Grazie ancora;8

486;50;2020-04-23;50;Antonio was very kind and wonder to have the flat in very good conditions for us.;10
487;50;2021-04-15;51;"Many thanks to Antonio!!! Very nice clean appartment,the breakfasts were excellent, a big choice of public transport, it takes above 16eur to get there from Duomo.Supermarket just a few steps away from the apartment. Distric has a ""liitle mountain"" with the picturesque panorama of the city.I advise to everyone Antonio's appartment.";9
488;50;2021-12-23;52;"Antonio is great, he helped me with EVERYTHING!! He always answered to my questions really quick! I could even use his bike to see the area of Bicocca. For all students attending the university of bicocca, the airbnb of Antonio is the spot to stay;)";10
489;50;2022-04-07;53;ho soggiornato nell'appartamento di Antonio per circa 2 mese! posso dire che è stata un'esperienza positiva su tutti i fronti. soprattutto per la disponibilità dell'host. unica nota negativa che posso segnalare anche se nel mio caso non è stato un grande problema è che la casa può ospitare 4 persone quindi sarebbe comodo avere sedie e stoviglie per 4. In ogni caso ottima esperienza!;9
490;50;2022-07-16;54;"Review from a Digital Nomad ***4 Word Summary*** Stay here, it's great! ***Detailed Review*** I stayed at Antonio's for almost 3 months. This is an excellent value and location. There is a dishwasher and clothes washer with a fun and easy to use clothes dryer on the ceiling of the bathroom which you can raise and lower quickly by hand using a hook. I loved using this. The curtains for the apartment’s windows are blackout which was perfect for watching movies on my portable projector in the living room. There is a desk for working and a reading chair in the bedroom. The closet space was well beyond my needs; I can't imagine any traveler needing more space. The internet was blazing fast. Better speed than I had back in California. Antonio welcomed me and made check in so easy especially with his detailed guide provided before arrival. He was always available to answer any questions I had and give me recommendations or assistance when needed; easy to do as he speaks English fluently. There is a tram stop right outside the apartment making it very easy to get into the central city within 20-30 minutes by metro or you can use the train station which is also directly across the street. Getting around was extremely convenient and easy; I could leave the apartment any time and find a tram or train departing within 20 minutes to where I wanted to go, using Google maps. The modern comfortable couch in the living room actually contains a pull out bed, convenient if you have the occasional guest. The stove is gas powered and there is a kettle for making tea, or like me, for coffee with an aeropress. I strongly recommend staying here as a digital nomad or as a traveler.";10
491;51;2017-09-14;55;Gostamos imenso do apartamento, da decoração e da recepção do anfitrião. Além disso, o apartamento estava bastante bem localizado e com o metro praticamente à porta de casa. Fomos muito bem recebidos. Obrigada! ;10

493;51;2017-10-12;57;Ho alloggiato con i miei amici per un weekend presso l'appartamento di Francesco. Purtroppo non abbiamo conosciuto personalmente l'host, ma si è rivelato molto flessibile per la gestione della consegna e della restituzione delle chiavi e ha sempre risposto prontamente alle nostre richieste. L'alloggio è gradevole ed arredato bene, ma purtroppo non pulitissimo come ci aspettavamo. La zona è ottimale, soprattutto per i giovani, tanti locali e ristoranti e facilissima da raggiungere con i mezzi pubblici, ideale per godersi un fine settimana a Milano.;8
494;51;2017-10-18;58;Francesco is very nice man and the communication was very easy.;10
495;51;2017-10-19;59;Francesco è stato molto gentile e disponibile con noi, ci ha accolto in modo cordiale e amichevole. Gli orari di check-in e check-out sono molto elastici . La posizione della casa era ottima, ben collegata, a due passi dalla fermata della metro verde Porta Genova. ;7

501;51;2019-01-01;65;Francesco is very friendly! The apartment was ok, but the towels and bedlinen were dirty. Hard to sleep in the morning due to Tram The location is very good.;10
502;51;2019-04-10;66;O apartamento do Francesco é excelente. Muito bem localizado, próximo ao metrô, tram na porta e próximo aos restaurantes no Navigli. O apartamento é um pouco barulhento por estar numa rua movimentada, o que para mim não foi um problema. A cozinha e os utensílios estavam um pouco sujos. Porém nada que comprometesse nossa estadia. Em resumo, o apartamento é muito bom, espaçoso e confortável para 4 pessoas. Quando voltar a Milão ficarei novamente no apartamento do Francesco. ;10
503;51;2020-04-18;67;Very nice area. We have been there for only one night, it was ok!;7

509;51;2022-05-02;73;Great host, superior location in Porta Genova, walking distance to Navigli & good bars and restaurants . Could be a bit cleaner and updated apartment, smell from the owners cat is present. But overall it's good for few days and if you are in the city during the day.;10

564;53;2022-07-29;143;밀라노에서 한 달 동안 어학연수를 위해 살 집을 찾던 중 발견했습니다. 방은 트윈베드 방 하나, 더블베드 방 하나 해서 총 두 개인데 거실에 엑스트라 베드가 하나 더 그리고 소파가 베드로 바뀌어서 최대 8명까지도 살 수 있을 정도로 여유롭습니다. 주방은 갖은 식기도구와 퐁퐁까지 완비되어 있고 오븐이 있는데 전자레인지도 있어서 정말 편했습니다. 세탁기는 엘지꺼라 역시나 가전은 엘지 답게 잘 돌아가요~ 건조기는 없지만, 베란다에 널어놓으면 세시간만에 바짝 말라서 빨래하기 편했습니다. 화장실은 먼저 수압 말할 필요도 없이 완벽했고 뜨거운 물 펄펄 나와서 샤워할 때마다 만족했습니다. 이태리식 비데를 쓰시는 분이시라면 이태리 비데도 있으니 편하실거예요. 그 외에 에어컨 잘 작동하였고, 방마다 선풍기 있으며 수건도 넉넉하게 서양인들 쓰는 그 크고 넓은거 다섯장, 한국인들이 쓰는 그정도 크기 다섯 장 해서 열 장 정도 제공되었습니다. 분리수거는 한국 정도로만 해서 지하층에 버리면 되고, 집에 쓰레기를 둘 필요가 없다보니 쾌적하게 집을 이용할 수 있었습니다. 그 외에 청소도구는 청소기부터 밀대, 곰팡이 제거제 등 모두 북박이장에 잘 들어있었고, 와이파이 정말 빨라요~ 끝 방 구석에서도 신호 세 칸 잡힐 정도로 신호도 강력합니다! 무엇보다 집 주인과의 소통이 이 집의 강점인 것 같아요. 어떤 문제가 있던 연락을 남기면 아무리 늦어도 한 시간 이내로 답이 오고 보통은 3분 이내로 답을 해주시더라구요. 아 그리고 집 주인분들의 세심한 센스를 돋볼 수 있던 것이, 장을 보러 갈 때 쓸 수 있는 카트부터 시작해서 집 창문마다 모기장 설치까지 그냥 완벽합니다. 세스토 마렐리 역이라서 조금 멀까봐 걱정하신다면 두오모역까지 15분 내로 도착 가능하시니 절대 걱정하지 마시고 여기로 오세요!;7
565;53;2022-09-13;128;Nico and Cinzia were great, from beginning to end. Highly recommended.;10

579;54;2021-04-09;142;I stayed for only 1 night but Maria Teresa was very welcoming and extremely helpful. We had 2 other guests at the same time in another room and the bathroom was shared but it worked out fine. No issues at all. Maria Teresa even woke up early to provide us with breakfast next morning when we were taking an early flight. The house is in a beautiful traditional building and less than 10 mins walk to the red line station Concialozone. Maria Teresa also provided me with a lot of details to help go around Milan and her daughter was very nice as well. I enjoyed my stay in the room with the terrace and would stay there again if I went to Milan;7

585;55;2021-02-03;149;Overall: 2 star experience;10
586;55;2021-04-18;150;What a fabulous place to stay! Nearby (metro-)station in the centre of Milan. Great host, she took good care of us and even left some food in the fridge. Nice chinees restaurant on the corner. The house is small but very oke to stay when you are visiting the city. Great place for 2 people. A quiet building in the hart of Milan. I could call the owner any time and she responded very quickly. Thank you Francesca to put your house open for us!;8
587;55;2021-04-22;151;Francesca è stata molto accogliente. Ci siamo trovati molto bene a casa sua: ci ha lasciato anche da mangiare. La casa è molto accogliente ed è situata vicino a due linee metro. Ottima esperienza. Grazie Francesca;10
588;55;2021-09-10;152;Il mio soggiorno al Nice Flat di Francesca è stato più che soddisfacente. il suo punto di forza credo che sia la posizione, è infatti ottimo per chi si deve spostare in centro o verso aeroporti e stazione. inoltre è accogliente e silenzioso. Francesca è stata disponibilissima per qualsiasi eventuale problema. alla prossima!!!!!;10
589;55;2022-04-13;153;Really convenient location - central, and close to 3 metro stations, so we could use different Metro lines or even S-line train depending on where we wanted to go. Francesca was a really good communicator prior and during the stay. ;10
590;55;2022-04-16;154;"The apartment is conveniently located just 5-10 min walk from the Central station. A bio food grocery shop is just around the corner. The surroundings are very calm and the windows face a little patio that is lit with sun most of the day. The flat is rather small, so it would be ideal for one person or a couple maximum. The rather small and simple kitchen could be the only downside - but then, why would you want to cook when traveling to Italy? ;)";10
591;55;2022-05-09;155;Beautiful location, quiet area and very easy to come to the city center. Flat is good for two people, it has everything you need to stay and Francesca is very hospitable. My only objection is the mattress on the bed in the bedroom that is too soft.;7
592;55;2022-06-09;156;I stayed in Francesca’s clean and tidy flat as a base during the Salone de Mobile, a great location for the trains and metro. Very short walk for local restaurants and Porta Nuova. Although the small but well stocked kitchen provides enough. My trip was unfortunately disrupted with health complications, Francesca however was the consummate host and helped organise delivery of my belongings to hospital - going above and beyond her duties as host.;9
593;56;2013-09-05;157;Very good location, directly in the heart of the Navigli area, which is known for great restaurants, bars and shops..;10
594;56;2015-03-26;158;Andrea e' un host disponibile e, sopratutto, flessibile rispetto alle esigenze e richieste degli ospiti. La sua casa e' gradevole e accogliente, posizionata in modo perfetto sia per chi avesse esigenze di lavoro, sia per chi volesse godere di un soggiorno nella vivace zona Tortona, poiché a 10 minuti dalla metropolitana. Tornerò probabilmente da Andrea alla prossima esigenza di soggiorno lavorativo a Milano.;8

617;56;2022-05-08;181;The stay in Andrea’s stunning loft apartment was a godsend after our original host cancelled on us last minute. Communication was brilliant, including local recommendations and places to visit near locales we planned on being in, and Andrea was very accommodating.

620;56;2022-06-06;184;Andrea was so helpful and communicative. After staying in the most touristy area of Milan, it was fun to feel more like a local in Andrea’s neighborhood. There was also a lot to do and see. The wonderful Mudec was in walking distance where we saw an excellent Chagall exhibit. Milan Design Week was starting and there were many installations in the area as well. Also, the lift was very helpful so we did not have to carry our bags up the stairs. I hope to get back to stay there again.;10
621;56;2022-09-30;185;Mi sono trasferita a Milano per tre mesi, l’accomodation di Andrea è stata perfetta. Ospitale come sentirsi a casa, comoda per il mio lavoro e per lo svago visto che vicino alla metro. La zona è molto tranquilla e ben servita.;10

Augusto created very warm atmosphere. Although the house is in the central part of the city it's very quiet and relaxing.

631;58;2020-06-21;195;Michele was very helpful to a 'damsel in distress'! I contacted him at the very last minute as my prior booking was cancelled and he responded within minutes. Within an hour I could check in. As I was on the street in Milan with only my suitcase, this was very welcome!;8
632;58;2020-10-13;196;Michele and his parents made us feel very welcome! His mom and dad are very nice people. They were the ones that settled us in. ;10

634;58;2021-09-22;198;Ottima ospitalità e ottima comunicazione;10
635;58;2021-09-27;199;"A nightmare host.. He made my life in the apartment a living hell. I was supposed to stay at Michele’s place for 2 months, but I left after 2 week. I couldn't take it anymore. I was afraid for my safety. I actually had to report him to Airbnb. Here are some main issues I had with him. - Michele was constantly intruding on my privacy. The first week he came in 3 times a day, just for random things. In the middle of work meeting, he used to ring the bell of the house at any time he wanted. He lived at his parents house, which was next to this apartment. - He was very discriminative and very disrespectful toward me. He humiliated me telling everyone in the building that I am dirty American ( which wasn’t true at all) . In the first week, he came in the apartment without my approval while I was out. His excuse was that he had to check “something”. He found the house a little messy and little dirty.. He went insane.. When he came to the house uninvited, his girlfriend called him and he told her many bad thing about me in Italian just because the house was a mess. It's crazy. Too bad he didn’t know that I spoke Italian very well. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. How can you treat you guest like this, especially since I was paying a lot of money for the house.. - He wanted me to pay a cleaning lady each week. He told me that in order for me to stay in the apartment, a cleaning lady should come every week and I was going to pay for it. At first, I agreed because I didn’t want to move again especially since I had a 2 year old daughter.. After a week, Michele told me that instead of once a week, the woman is going to come 2 a week. It was crazy because the house was not dirty at all. However, this was a way for him to control me and intrude on my privacy. When I refused, for the cleaning lady to come, he kept messaging me everyday.. that someone needs to come and ""clean"" the house.. Despite me telling him NO many times - I almost attacked by Michelle and his people for refusing the cleaning lady to come and clean the house twice a week, instead of one time. It was so upsetting because my daughter had to witness the whole confrontation. I spoke to Airbnb and I was told that I was not supposed to have a cleaning lady come to the house since it was not what is agreed in Airbnb and Michele had not included that under the rules. - There were so many muscidoes in the house because there are many trees. It was awful. My daughter and I were covered with muscidoes bides. When I complained, Michele told me the muscidoes were because the house was dirty. Crazy.. - Internet was awful. There was no internet in the bedroom. I had to have meetings in the bathroom because the Internet came from his parents house. Before I even booked this place, I even send him a message to make sure the internet was good because I had to work. He said it was great. - It was very hot inside the unit. No air conditioner. I told him to at least buy a small fan for my daughter since she is a baby and can’t handle the heat. Nothing.. heartless host. All he carried about was his apartment";9
636;58;2021-11-07;200;"I have spent more than a month in Michele’s apartment and I had really great time. Michele is the perfect host, very welcoming and ready to help with any need. The apartment is spacious and has every comfort, such as a well equipped kitchen, large bedroom and living room, and a clean bathroom. The location is great, the area is full of supermarkets, bars, and some restaurants. I never used public transportation to go around the city; Duomo, Castle; museums are maximum 30 minutes by walking. However, stops of subway and tram are really close. I definitely recommend staying here. Thanks Michele for all your support during my long stay.";10
637;58;2022-02-28;201;Whoever is looking for probably the best place to stay in Milan, should not pass up on the opportunity to stay at the green oasis. Oasis was definitely the right word to use when choosing to name this listing - it is a calm and beautiful place, an overall idyllic getaway! Michele was extremely communicative, helpful, kind and just an overall amazing host. We felt extremely happy and supported throughout our stay (Michele even recommended us numerous lovely restaurants and bars around the city since he had lived in Milan for many years). The flat is located in one of the most safest and cleanest areas in Milan. This was an amazing plus for my friend and I as we love going on walks so the neighbourhood was a lovely area to explore. We also went on morning runs and we were able to do so because the flat is near a beautiful park called Sempione, with many cute dogs going on walks too :) we also had a lovely picnic there when it was sunny! During the weekends there is a fantastic fruit and vegetable market which is really only five minutes from the flat - we found probably the best olives I’ve ever had there! There are also many small cafes, juice places, a Starbucks, clothing shops (such as H&M), carrefour and pharmacies only 5-10 minutes away too! To review the flat, it was such a clean, beautiful and sunny space - we enjoyed living there so much and would love to come back soon! The flat is so so nice with high ceilings, beautiful wooden flooring and amazing furniture. We could not have asked for a better temporary home. Thank you for the amazing time Michele :);7
638;58;2022-06-26;202;Spacious apartment in a quiet neighbourhood of Milan. Within walking distance from city attractions and a very pleasant walk to the city centre.;9
639;58;2022-09-13;203;Very spacious apartment! Michele was very accommodating during our travel delays. Our train from Florence was canceled so we came a day later than scheduled. The neighborhood was very quiet and nice to explore. We didn't realize the apartment doesn't have AC so we slept with the windows open so keep that in mind (our fault for not looking at the listing details haha)! It was pretty warm during the day, but I can see it being totally fine during the winter. The mattress was also very firm so heads up if you have a bad back. Overall the space was charming!;10
640;58;2022-09-24;204;Michele was a lovely host. He was very attentive and helpful. His apartment in milan is perfect! Two seperate balconies to enjoy during the day, a quiet street and lots to offer near by. Highly recommend;10
641;59;2020-04-20;205;Benny was a brilliant host . A combination of privacy and imidiate help when needed. The rooftop apartment was perfect for us (4 adults ). The terrace, the garden, the flowers. And of course - kuma. A wonderful experience. In a great location. Thank you.;8
642;59;2021-02-09;206;La casa é molto bella es accogliete e il piano su cui abbiamo alloggiato molto tranquillo e silenzioso. La zona é céntrica ed è semplice muoversi sia a piedi che con i mezzi. Benny e i suoi figli ci hanno fatto sentire comode, come fossimo a casa nostra! Grazie :);10
643;59;2021-03-24;207;Lovely place. Super good location, old Milanese family home -style place. Amazing views! Downside: We had issues with the elevator, and you’re not allowed to take the stairs as they lead through the family apartments. Inconvenient but only happened once. The place is beautiful but very dusty, as it’s quite an old attic type of space. Huge drawback that we got a sofa bed and not a double bed as advertised! There is a fridge and coffee machine etc, so no issue what so ever with not having a kitchen. Amazing terrace!;10
644;59;2021-10-27;208;Great place in a beautiful neighbourhood. Super hostess.;10
645;59;2022-05-08;209;Everything was perfect, thank you very much. It is a wunderful place in a quiete neighborhood. We would love to come again!;9
646;59;2022-10-08;210;Buena ubicación cerca de lugares de interés, la anfitriona muy preocupada, un agrado.;10
647;60;2022-05-15;211;Everything was fantastic, only acoustic was quite bad :((;10
648;60;2022-05-23;212;The room is pretty much as described and pictured. It is in a good location and you know you will get looked after by Francesca. I recommend.;8
649;60;2022-05-28;213;wszystko zgodne z opisem, polecam!;10
650;60;2022-06-05;214;Really close to public transport and the centre. Kind welcoming hosts. Good place to stay to explore the area and Milan.;10
651;60;2022-06-12;230;Tres bon séjour a Milan chez Francesca ! Bel accueil, tout est a disposition pour se sentir à l'aise et Francesca est disponible.;10
652;60;2022-06-26;216;Very good accommodation for the price. The only issue was that on Saturday night it was a bit noisy outside (there was some party in the complex) so it was difficult to fall asleep.;9
653;60;2022-07-03;217;Beautiful house and nice host. Francesca and Robyn are passionate in helping us, though the location is actually quite far away from the city centre. If there is enough time spent in Milan, the location isn't a problem.;10
654;60;2022-07-06;218;Krásné a útulné ubytování 4 kilometry od centra Milána. Spolubydlící majitelky Robyn, která nám vše ukázala a vysvětlila byla naprosto skvělá a milá. Všem co cestují do Milána bych doporučil.;9
655;60;2022-07-11;219;Amazing guest house. Great location a tram ride from the city. The communication is great, Francesca and Robyn are on hand to give any recommendations about Milan. I would definitely stay here again!;10
656;60;2022-08-03;220;Great place! Only a 20-25 minute bus ride to the city centre and the room is equipped with everything we needed. Francesca is a great host - super accommodating and easy to communicate with. She left us with a nice breakfast and even did our laundry for us!;10
657;60;2022-08-09;221;The stay at Francesca's place was very good. The place is exactly like on The Photos. Francesca gave us a little breakfast like yougurts and cornflakes and something sweet. she gave us a fresh water everyday. One night it was a little bit noisy but it was acceptable :) We have a great time in Milano!;10
658;60;2022-08-14;222;Francesca ist eine sehr sympathische und hilfsbereite Gastgeberin! Direkt bei der Ankunft gab es bereits viele Tipps rund zu Mailand und Busverbindungen, sogar kleine selbstgestaltete Karten liegen in der Wohnung bereit. Die Unterkunft ist gemütlich und sauber und wir haben uns während unseres Aufenthalts sehr wohl gefühlt!;7
659;60;2022-08-20;223;Ty ty ty so much for everything!;8
660;60;2022-08-22;224;Rien à redire, Accueil agréable. Francesca nous a bien conseillé pour les bus ect. Brasserie à côté très coool ! Au plaisir;10
661;60;2022-08-28;225;Francesca is a great host, we have been traveling via hostels through Europe and came across Francesca place and we decided to get some refresh time outside of the hostel. Not only did she have a bunch of things for breakfast but she was gracious to do our laundry as well. I would 100% recommended staying with Francesca and with the bus access very close to the place it is a quick ride to central Milan.;10
662;60;2022-09-04;226;Nice private location, good vibes and Francesca is a great host. We would recommend!;9
663;60;2022-09-06;227;Had a lovely stay. Great for a few nights in milan, only a short bus ride from the centre, and in a lovely complex with a nice bar nearby. We had everything we needed in the apartment, including some breakfast foods, and information to get around the area and find restaurants.;10
664;60;2022-09-08;228;Perfect host, perfect apartment;10
665;60;2022-09-26;215;房东非常细心！在每一个细小之处都有用心的去安排，并且有一只可爱的猫陪伴，住宿体验非常棒！;10
666;60;2022-10-03;231;Lovely little place. Really enjoyed are stay there. Was a little out of the city centre (half hour bus ride) but perfect if you want to enjoy Milan but escape the hustle and bustle of the city centre when needed. Fran was an amazing host (and her lovely little cat 🐱) and nothing was to much for her. Would definitely recommend this place.;8
667;60;2022-10-08;232;Francesca is a super helpful and supportive. Her place is very cool & cosy and not far from the city center;10
668;60;2022-10-10;233;Francesca es una excelente persona que va mucho más allá de sus responsabilidades como host, nos hizo sentir como en casa. La ubicación está muy bien conectada con transporte público y eso nos ayudó mucho.;10
669;60;2022-10-31;234;Nos ha gustado mucho el lugar, es muy tranquilo y cerca de los buses volveríamos a ir 😊;7
670;60;2022-11-02;235;Francesca was very helpful, provided with various breakfast and information for the attractions. There's map and guide available as well.;10
671;60;2022-11-07;236;The accomodation at Francesca was very nice, clean and had everything you need and more. Francesca was a great host, always replied fast to messages, provided us with some yoghurt and small cakes for breakfast. It's a bit further from the city centre but there's a direct bus going to duomo, so it was no problem. Would definitely recommend!;9
672;60;2022-11-09;237;Camera ospitale e confortevole. Posizione ottima per i mezzi. Grande gentilezza e disponibilità da parte di Francesca;10
673;60;2022-11-14;238;Excellent, Francesca was an excellent host, always kind and willing to help;10
674;60;2022-11-20;239;Absolutely wonderful spot in Milan, with a cafe and bar super close. As well as easy commute to the main city. With a wonderful host who will help you figure out the city.;9
675;60;2022-11-27;240;Brava persona;10
676;60;2022-12-04;241;We loved our stay, Francesca was so helpful and welcoming, the place is so cute !;10
677;61;2022-09-18;242;"Der Loft ist genau so schön wie auf den Bildern, herrlich ruhig im Hinterhof gelegen und sehr originell und bunt eingerichtet. Einzig das Sofabett war etwas unbequem, aber wir sind auch nicht mehr die Jüngsten.. ;-) Das Navigliquartier mit den vielen Restaurants und Bars um die Ecke hat uns sehr gefallen. Angelo war ein äusserst zuvorkommender Gastgeber, immer sehr schnell und freundlich in seinen Antworten. Wir kommen gerne wieder!";8
678;61;2022-09-20;243;The apartment is in a good.location about 10 minutes walk from Romolo station and near the canal which has lots of cafes and from which you can walk to the magnificent duomo...about 30 minutes' walk. the flat is in a private courtyard and has 2 double beds (one on same floor as the kitchen and bathroom) and one on thr ground floor with patio doors to the courtyard garden. This bed is mattresseson the floor and there are two bunk beds in this room too. The bedding is very clean. there is a small book/sofa area on a mezzanine level. perfect for a short stay in Milan and Angelo is very helpful ..;10
679;61;2022-09-21;244;La casa è realmente come nella descrizione! Pazzesca. Molto spaziosa, ben arredata e a 5 minuti dai Navigli. Nonostante questo sembra di stare in una località di campagna lontano dal caos della città. Consigliatissima.;10
680;61;2022-09-24;245;Homely stay in a private and secure area around 10 minutes walk from the main areas for food and drink on Navigli;9
681;61;2022-09-28;246;it'sgood, looks just like th picture;10
682;61;2022-09-29;215;入住描述非常清楚，房东回复很快。 热水很快，空调好像不太好用，不过米兰当时温度还算舒适，稍微有点冷。室内家具多数为木制，自制家具比较多，房东很热爱木工。周围靠近地铁站Ⓜ️800米左右，也有公交站。吃的选择比较少。有超市。屋子角落有很多灰尘。驱蚊设施不好用。性价比一般。可能因为当时米兰活动与游客很多，造成价格很高。;10
683;61;2022-10-03;247;Great place in a hip area of Milan. Near public transport and a variety of shops. The apartment was nice.;7
684;61;2022-10-14;248;My second time here and will definitely come back again;9
685;61;2022-10-16;249;L’appartement étais bien equipé et meublé, facilement accesible. Angelo nous a permis de faire le chek-out plus tard sans soucis. Je recommande ce logement près du Naviglio. Les voisins son aussi très sympas;10
686;61;2022-10-22;250;Nice location near the canal offers probably something different to the other places. Good instructions for easy access to the keys.;10
687;61;2022-10-23;251;Location was great and is a great Place For a family to stay. A bit cramped for 4 adults woman;8
688;61;2022-10-26;252;1;2
689;61;2022-11-01;253;The location is very quiet, convenient to commute with public transportation. However, we were disappointed by missing equipments, such as bread toaster, kettle, washing towel, small pan. In addition, the cleaniness was unsatisfactory. Globally, the pictures do not give an up to date impression of the reality.;9
690;61;2022-11-11;254;"Superbe petite ambiance ""Atelier loft"" dans une cours charmante au calme. Metro a proximité pour se rendre rapidement partout dans dans Milan. Beaucoup de charme ! je recommande";10
691;61;2022-11-14;255;A lovely little space but definitely not made for 5. It’s a three maximum or if you want more three couples.;9
692;61;2022-11-19;256;bel appartement dans le quartier de Navigli. Angelo est très réactif et serviable. merci;10
693;61;2022-11-20;257;La casa molto carina come in foto in una zona tranquilla. Il check in semplicissimo.;10
694;61;2022-11-27;258;The apartment is a charming artist place with a nice and modern architectural style which is very lofty and open. But it is not perfect for toddlers (too many steep stairs) and there is not much privacy due to the open rooms. We had a very good stay at Angelo’s place.;10
695;61;2022-12-04;259;The arrival and departure was super smooth. Appartement is great for 6 people. Location is a bit far from the center but very nice neighborhood (Navigli is young & cool).;10
696;62;2020-06-05;260;Firstly let me start by saying Simone is now a friend. In a way this is the beauty of Airbnb once a formal host, now a great friend. ;10
697;62;2021-04-21;261;We stayed in Simone's apartment during the design week. Simone welcome us very friendly and he was very helpful during our stay. The Location was great just 5 min walk to Pt Genova metro station. The apartment was compact but really nice and clean. ;10
698;62;2021-05-19;262;The flat is exactly like in the pictures ! We were like in the 70' in a very nice area of Milano, full of life...;9
699;62;2021-10-01;263;Good location and colorful house decoration. Convenient! ;10
700;62;2021-10-08;264;Simone was a really nice host. We welcomed us warmly in his beautiful apartment and gave us some advices to visit and enjoy Milan. The apartment is exactly like on the pictures and is very well located on the Naviglii ! We had a perfect trip to Milan thanks to this place and Simone !;10
701;62;2021-10-15;265;Simone’s apartment is an excellent place to stay while in Milan. Check-in/Check out was seamless and he was so welcoming and helpful with everything from local restaurant suggestions, day-to-day life in the neighborhood, to the best nightlife in Milan. His apartment is decorated with a fun and unique style and we enjoyed wonderful sweeping views of the canal and neighboring picturesque rooftops of the bustling Navigli district. Great host, fun neighborhood (especially in the evening) and cool, unique loft apartment…So happy we stayed here and we hope to return soon!;7
702;62;2021-11-18;266;Simone is a great host. He was traveling, but left us excellent tips on milan, restaurants and bars. The flat is fun, colorful and best location in town for those who love the nightlife, the navigli. Also, it is near the Metro Porta Genova, 5 minutes walking. We love and we intend to return. Thanks Simone!;10
703;62;2021-12-18;267;"We just left Simone's apartment and we had great time. What a unique place to find on airbnb! The house was perfectly decorated, with attention to detail, reflecting a tasteful man's lifestyle. (This may be so for us as we seem to be like-minded; it can be a bit too much for minimalist lifestyles). The front terrace, facing the canal is a perfect corner to experience Milan, even while indoors. We couldn't meet Simone in person as he was travelling at the time of our stay, but he still served great as a host from miles away. Celeste, was extremely helpful on his behalf, she had to come twice for our extra needs. We really appreciate their kindness and helpful tips on the area. We look forward to visiting Milan and staying at the same place again, in future! Definitely recommended for retro and Escher lovers!";8
704;62;2022-01-04;268;Appartement splendide, si vous voulez vous plonger dans les années 70. Impeccable, chaleureux, vraiment n'hésitez pas un seul instant. L'appartement est beaucoup plus spacieux qu'il ne paraît sur les photos.;10
705;62;2022-01-21;269;Very stylish place, great location. We had a wonderful stay. ;10
706;62;2022-01-28;270;The apartment is lovely and very good located. You have bars, restaurants and good public transportation. We enjoyed our time in and around the place and got good recommendations to visit.;9
707;62;2022-04-23;271;A great spot in Milan in Navigli. Lovely host, playful decor. Loved it!;10
708;62;2022-04-29;272;Appartamento consigliatissimo per posizione, pulizia, accoglienza e arredamento unico nel suo genere!;10
709;62;2022-05-13;273;This place is SOOOO unique, beautiful, and full of character. Seriously, this was probably the coolest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. Simone & Celeste are super accommodating, quick to respond, and very helpful! There is no Air Conditioning in the apartment, though this can be solved by opening the windows. The location is about 25-30 minutes walking distance from the Duomo, though this isn’t an issue at all if you don’t mind a walk or public transportation. Anyway, I can’t rate this place highly enough. Such a cool vibe for a weekend getaway. If you’re looking for a unique experience, come here. 😄;10
710;62;2022-05-21;274;Very nice location ! Perfect for a stay in Milano.;10
711;62;2023-01-01;275;Super appartement, super localisation, super design ! Simone est très attentif à ce que le séjour se passe au mieux. Il nous a envoyé un mot pour savoir si nous étions bien arrivés puis si tout se passait comme souhaité. L'appartement est très propre, fidèle aux photos de l'annonce, à deux pas du tram, au calme et surtout avec une déco terrible ! Merci pour ce super séjour que nous avons passé, nous reviendrons avec grand plaisir !;10
712;62;2023-03-20;276;This place was perfect for our stay in Milan! Besides the obvious colourful and unique decor, it also always felt a little bit like coming home after a long day of sightseeing. Simone provided a list of restaurant recommendations for the area which we used almost every day and it saved us from the many touristy spots around Navigli. If you’re very sensitive to noise this might not be your area since there are a lot of bars open all night. We didn’t mind it at all though. 5/5 overall experience!;9
713;63;2022-01-08;277;The perfect stay, in a perfect place, with a perfect host.;10
714;63;2022-02-13;278;Sono tornata in questo appartamento che ha come punto di forza la sua posizione davvero invidiabile, vicino piazza Duomo. Lo stabile poi e' davvero notevole. Tutto a portata: negozi, metro, bus, tram.....le bellezze del centro di Milano. Lo consiglio.;8
715;63;2022-03-01;279;The location of the apartment is beyond incredible, also Alba is such a wonderful host, the communication has always been very easy. The apartment is exactly as shown in the pictures and has everything you’ll need for a comfortable stay. I definitely recommend this apartment x;10
716;63;2022-03-20;280;Alba Maria is a great host. She was very kind and helpful, always ready to give tips and other good suggestions. Alba even left a bottle of Prosecco in the fridge for us. Also, her place is great, close to Duomo. Highly recommended!;10
717;63;2022-04-24;281;Lovely place in an excellent location -- very close to most of what you want to see in Milan but in a bit of a quieter block. Particularly nice bathroom. Attentive and helpful host! Would stay again.;10
718;63;2022-05-13;282;Such a great stay! This Airbnb is right in the heart of Milan, a 5 minute walk from Duomo. It’s spacious, clean and makes you feel at home. Alba was great, she’s extremely attentive and was there for any questions and recommendations. She was also giving us timely directions on how to get to the Airbnb from the airport. Great value for money!;10
719;63;2022-05-24;283;Excellent location and accommodating, helpful host... with a beautiful/cultured apartment in Milan;7
720;63;2022-06-16;284;We had a wonderful stay in Alba’s apartment! The location is ideal, and the apartment nice an quiet. It is a lovely space, and the old ceiling in the bedroom. The bathroom is updated and is impressive. We enjoyed spending time out in the patio. Alba was very helpful with transportation suggestions at each end of the trip. And answered all questions promptly.;10
721;63;2022-06-19;285;Fantastic location, host was very communicative. Please make note - particularly if you are in Milan during the summer - there is not air conditioning at this location.;9
722;63;2022-06-21;286;Clean, cozy beautiful and perfectly located for a visit to Milan. Alba was super helpful throughout the planning process and stay. I appreciate the flexibility and care that she gave us, it made our quick stay in Milan comfortable. Tamara, the lady who cleans the apartment was also very pleasant and made sure we had everything we needed. I would stay there again. Thank you Alba for all your help!;10
723;63;2022-07-03;287;Alba’s place is fantastically located in period building in the centre of Milan only moments from the Duomo and within walking distance of many other sights, shops, restaurants, galleries. It is very securely located within a smart arcade with doorman which gave reassurance. Alba could not have been a more attentive host … always immediately contactable and full of helpful advice and fabulous recommendations for great restaurants. We hope to return for longer next time.;10
724;63;2022-07-18;288;Alba is a very thoughtful host who was very good with communication and suggestions for both sightseeing and restaurants. The location is also excellent. I did not realize there is no air conditioning and our stay in July was extremely hot. An additional fan would have been helpful. We weren’t able to use the terrace as it wasn’t clean and had pigeons.;8
725;63;2022-08-21;289;Fabulous stay in every respect. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at Alba's apartment again - it's location is perfect, a couple of minutes walk from the Duomo and very close to Metro stops, it's central but a very quiet spot. The apartment itself is lovely with a fantastic terrace. Alba is a perfect host - communication is superb and Alba is incredibly helpful and was in regular contact and provided helpful tips for the local area. Check in and out were seemless. And the gift of a huge pack of Parmesan cheese was a lovely touch. All in all a perfect stay.;10
726;63;2022-08-23;290;Die Wohung entspricht exakt der Beschreibung und den Bildern. Die Lage ist super zentral unweit des Domes und dennoch ruhig. Ideal als Basis für die Erkundung der Stadt. Die Terasse zum Innenhof ist ein Highlight. Wer morgens etwas Zeit hat kann draußen frühstücken. Alles war sehr sauber und perfekt für uns vorbereitet. Alba hat auf Rückfragen schnell reagiert und ist eine ausgezeichnete Gastgeberin.;9
727;63;2022-09-10;291;Love my stay with Alba, very convenient and center to the main plaza and shopping stores.;10
728;63;2022-09-14;292;Situated in a perfect location, very easy to get around with public transportation and walking distance to amazing restaurants. Her place is great, very clean and has everything you need. Alba was also very helpful since the beginning, available at all times whenever we had any questions. Totally recommend it.;8
729;63;2022-09-18;293;Alba is super welcoming and supportive, responds within minutes — the communication is easy and uncomplicated. The apartment is exceptionally beautiful and clean and very well taken care off. Perfect location to explore Milano by foot or public transport. Thanks for an exceptionally nice and pleasant stay.;10
730;63;2022-10-02;294;Alba’s place is great. Close to the Duomo, the castello sforzesco, teatro scala, shops, restaurants (the restaurant downstairs is just phenomenal.) and everything you might need. I’ll definitely stay there again!;10
731;63;2022-10-10;295;Lovely host, perfect location, charming and very inviting.;10
732;63;2022-11-06;296;Alba was extremely helpful and responsive to all of our questions about the apartment and about Milano in general. Her apartment is about 2 blocks from the Duomo and pretty much within 20 minutes walk to almost every site that we were interested in visiting, and within 5 minutes of the piazza and the Duomo. The apartment is quiet for the most part, though one can slightly feel the trams passing the front of the building. It’s safe and there are two markets within a 5 minute walk. I would call it suitable for 2 or 3 people and the terrace would be great for outdoor dinners or quiet evenings. Her housekeeper, Tamara was also very helpful during check-in helping us to understand where things were located in the apartment and how various things worked. Pretty much an ideal spot for exploring central Milano.;9
733;63;2022-11-13;297;great place to stay. very central. extremely helpful host;10
734;64;2018-04-13;298;Nice and simple room at 5min from metro, perfect for visiting the center of Milano. Nice and helpful people living there. I remind this flat for next time.;8
735;64;2018-11-06;299;A wonderful Air BnB experience!! We were lucky enough to find this flat at very short notice, and Anna was very communicative and prompt.

741;64;2020-04-20;305;La experiencia de estar en casa de Anna fue muy buena. Todas las chicas son muy amables y dispuestas a ayudar con lo que sea. Nos prepararon el mejor desayuno, y pudimos sentarnos a hablar un rato y conocernos mejor. El apartamento está muy bien conectado por Metro con el centro, por lo que tienen una magnífica ubicación.;9
742;64;2020-07-30;306;Accoglienza precisa, disponibilità e gentilezza massima. Il quartiere è comodissimo da raggiungere e la casa si trova a 50 metri dalla metro, una comodità utile e gradevole, la stanza è carina e pulita e il bagno è praticamente personale. Sono rimasto molto soddisfatto.;10

745;64;2021-04-10;309;Foi muito agradável ficar no espaço de Anna. Apesar dela estar ausente, fomos muito bem recebidos pela Elena, Luciano e Agnese, todos sempre com um sorriso no rosto. O apartamento é confortável e próximo da estação de metrô, supermercado e restaurantes. Voltando a Milão queremos ficar novamente com eles. Recomendamos! Anaerto e Taíze;10
746;64;2021-04-19;310;Zona molto bella e tranquilla. Appartamento pulito. Accoglienza cordiale e famiare;8
747;64;2021-04-21;311;The room is quite clean and tidy. The host are very easy to communicate with and the location is convenient for public transportation. Will recommend for a short stay in Milan. Might be a little noisy because it’s near a crowded street;10
748;64;2021-07-12;312;Thank you for great accommodation. Anna's roommates were great and they always gave us a good advice.;10
749;64;2021-08-03;313;We had a great time at Ana’s place! It was very cosy and super close to the metro;9
750;64;2021-09-23;314;Nice location, quite big room and private bathroom. Host it's easy to communicate and always helpful.;10
751;65;2022-05-26;315;We stayed three nights at Anna's place and it worked out very well. Her flat is located on the sixth floor of a residence, which itself is a 2mn walk from the Precotto metro station (making it very easy to get into the town centre of Milano - 15mn metro ride). Anna lives there with two other guys, of which one was there to welcome us when Anna couldn't. We got to use the kitchen as much as we wanted to, which was great. The bathroom was shared as well. The double bedroom was nice and spacious with a double bed, a desk and some cupboard space. The WiFi worked very well. Anna was a very nice host who gave us our private space, even if she lived in the room opposite us. She was very flexible with our departure time. We had a lovely stay here and would recommend it for anyone wanting to visit Milano and Lake Como!;10
752;65;2022-06-05;316;Anna and her flatmates are incredibly kind and helpful people! The room is cleaned to perfection and provides anything you can ask for! With the subway-station right next to the flat you are never far from wherever you want to be in milan. 10/10 value, would definitely go again.;7
753;65;2022-06-09;317;Anna es muy amable, excelente comunicación. La habitación es amplia y la ubicación muy buena ya que está muy cerca del metro. Todo muy bien.;10

756;65;2022-06-21;298;Bardzo miła Pani Anna, bardzo pomocna, kontakt sprawny, mimo opóźnienia zameldowania z powodu opóźnienia lotu nie było żadnego problemu. Lokalizacja super ponieważ jest blisko do metra. Bardzo blisko znajdzie się też lokalną piekarnię oraz market, więc szybko można zorganizować posiłek. Do użytku była kuchnia, miejsce w lodówce oraz klimatyzacja w pokoju.;10
757;65;2022-07-15;320;Siamo state ospiti di Anna e le sue amiche per 4 splendidi giorni, siamo state accolte, oltre che da un bellissimo e forse insolito sole milanese, anche da persone gentilissime, simpaticissime e molto disponibili che hanno reso il nostro breve soggiorno delizioso!! L'appartamento è grazioso e dispone di tutti i comfort necessari, è situato in una zona facilmente raggiungibile con la metro e la zona dispone di ogni tipo di servizio (supermercato, panificio, macelleria, bar ecc). Siamo davvero soddisfatte!! Sicuramente se dovesse ricapitare di essere nuovamente a Milano non esiteremo a contattare Anna.;9
758;65;2022-08-08;321;It was our first time visiting Milan and we decided to travel by car. It was very easy to get to the apartment and there was the possibility of free parking just around the corner. Perfect! When we arrived Anna was there to welcome us warmly. We immediately felt comfortable at the place. The double room and bathroom looked exactly like in the photos... big, comfortable and clean.;10
759;65;2022-08-19;322;Tutto perfetto!Le ragazze sono gentilissime, disponibili e simpatiche! La stanza è come descritta, comodissima, niente da dire! Non è mancato assolutamente niente! Il quartiere è tranquillo, dotato di tutto e in 15 minuti si arriva in centro! Se dovesse ricapitare tornerei più che volentieri!! :);9
760;65;2022-09-14;323;Anna è stata molto gentile e disponibile. La stanza è davvero spaziosa e l'aria condizionata ha reso le mie notti molto più piacevole. A pochi metri dall'appartamento c'è tutto quello che può servire metri compresa;10
761;65;2022-09-20;324;Ce séjour chez Anna était génial ! Une très bonne communication, des conseils pour les visites dans Milan. L'accueil était top, explications claires Salle de bain et cuisine fonctionnelle (j'ai adoré apprendre à faire du café italien). L'appartement est idéalement situé près du métro m1 et près des magasins d'alimentation (les pizzeria du coin sont délicieuses). La chambre est spacieuse et tout était propre (les essuies étaient fournis). Je recommande fortement cet airbnb;10
762;65;2022-09-25;325;All good!;10
763;66;2020-10-13;326;Excellent location, very cooperative host. The flat is not new, but very clean and cozy. The possibility of parking at moderate price is a plus.;10
764;66;2020-10-15;327;This is a stylish, clean and spacious apartment in the heart of Milan. If anything, the published description is modest. We only stayed there for only two days, but it would have been extremely comfortable for a week or more. I would recommend this apartment to anyone.;9

766;66;2020-10-27;329;Appartamento molto confortevole e silenzioso e in pieno centro di Milano. La sua ubicazione è stata comodissima per me per il lavoro. Consiglio a tutti questa casa sia per un soggiorno vacanza che per lavoro !;10
767;66;2020-12-03;330;Questo è stato il mio secondo soggiorno da Angela. Tutto era perfetto com’è l’ultima volta. La casa è pulita e ben servita. La location è imbattibile per il centro di Milano, con il parcheggio privato incluso.;10
768;66;2021-02-24;331;Angela is an excellent host, super helpful and accommodating which made our business trip so much easier! Flat is beautiful, spacious and very very central. Would definitely come back;10
769;66;2021-02-28;337;Апартаменты расположены в самом центре Милана, рядом находятся все исторические памятники города, чудесный парк, недалеко центральный вокзал.

776;66;2021-11-03;338;Appartamento molto carino e silenzioso, Zona perfetta per raggiungere i luoghi più importanti a piedi. Ospitalità ineccepibile.;10
777;66;2021-12-09;339;This is a fantastic apartment in the heart of Milan. Immaculately presented (probably one of the cleanest flat I've used) in a quiet but nevertheless strategic location. Benefits of off-street parking too. You can't go wrong here!;9
778;66;2022-04-14;340;Angela is extremely personable and helpful. Her place is very well located and is immaculately clean. The shower has great pressure. The bed is comfortable and the balcony is very nice to use for a break of nature in the center of the city.;10

786;68;2021-04-14;348;Very nice apartment and the room was nice too.;10
787;68;2021-04-08;349;Esmeralda and Luca family were very friendly and provided local knowledge of where to visit around the suburbs. The room was very clean with several metro stops from Milan centre. Thank you Esmeralda and Luca for the stay !;10
788;68;2021-04-13;350;This was a home away from home. Esmeralda and her family made me feel more than welcome and I must say I have new friends. Their home is spotless clean, simple, beautiful and comfortable. The area has a very good feel, and just on the red line that takes you everywhere. So if you are looking for calm and quiet neighborhood and a real feel, this is the place.;10
789;68;2021-10-27;351;La casa si trova in una posizione eccellente, vicino a tutti i servizi essenziali e alla metro. L'appartamento è all'ottavo piano con una vista su tutta Milano, è moderno e funzionale. La sistemazione è una camera da letto singola, con scrivania e armadio. Ma quello che sicuramente fa la differenza è l'accoglienza di tutta la famiglia, che mi ha fatto sentire come se fossi andata a trovare dei parenti e mi ha messo subito a mio agio. Esmeralda e suo marito Luca, ma anche il piccolo Alessandro sono stati super disponibili, gentili e molto calorosi e da buona ragazza del sud ho veramente apprezzato la loro accoglienza!;9
790;68;2022-09-25;352;Esmeralda and Luca were wonderful hosts, going out of their way to help me out and make me feel at home. The room was spotless and the apartment is lovely and bright with a lovely location. Can't recommend them enough ☺️;10
791;68;2022-10-09;353;Ich hab bei Esmeralda einen total sehr schönen Aufenthalt erlebt. Es war ein familiäre Atmosphäre. Wir haben mal zusammen gefrühstückt und mehrmals auch uns unterhalten. Esmeralda war super nett, freundlich und immer schnell geantwortet, wenn ich sie was gefragt habe. Die Wohnung ist sehr sauber und ist sehr gut gestattet. Was mir am meisten gefallen ist der Balkon mit sehr schönem Ausblick. Kann nur Empfehlen;10
792;69;2021-02-06;354;Emanuela is a great host and very friendly . I was always given advices from her where to go visit and where to shop! The apartment is perfectly located near subway and tram , also very close to walk pretty much anywhere . ;10
793;69;2021-05-13;355;500 words is simply not enough to describe how great Emanuela is as a host and a friend. Emanuela keeps her apartment clean, she is a pleasure to live with, and the location is great. The city is at your fingertips here. Emanuela is also the best at giving travel suggestions-how to get off of the beaten trail, where to eat, where to stay, etc. The apartment is quite spacious and very comfortable. Manu is a BLAST!!! Highly recommended!!!!;8

Il mio soggiorno è durato poco più di un mese, e mi sono trovato molto bene. Emanuela è sempre molto cordiale ed ospitale.;9
797;70;2018-11-15;359;What a cool place! Love how it is connected with buses and subway! Perfect stay!;10
798;70;2018-12-29;360;Simply perfect!;10
799;70;2019-04-12;361;Dav is the man. You won't regret renting from him.;8
800;70;2019-04-24;362;The home is very clean and good localization. Dav is very helpful. Definitely I recommend the place.;10
801;70;2019-08-14;363;Davide’s place was kind of a disappointment, it lacked a lot of maintenance, had things like a sofa that slips on the balcony and other kinds of ignored old trash trough the house. Everything seems too improvised and very poorly made. Do not recommended this place.;10
802;70;2019-10-01;364;Davide is a wonderful and thoughtful host.;9
803;70;2019-10-31;365;Davide is a great host, very kind and helpful, even if living abroad it provides support and easy communication. Unfortunately I can't say the same for the apartment: It's old and the room was quite damp, generally furnished in a fancy way but the stuff in the house is basically recovered furniture in bad state of maintenance. Poor or old kitchen equipment, lots of stuff was broken (chairs, etc). In my room the bed had lacked slats and the ones still attached felt down at the first sit, generally I have to say that the apt doesn't value the money asked. Sorry;10
804;70;2019-11-23;366;I use Airbnb for 5 years.this is the first time I write negative feedback,but I have to do .it’s really mess,nightmare,disaster,whatever the flat,and the landlord. 1.about the apartment. -at least power cut for three times in evening,it’s really scared us.one time power cut during daytime.in that moment,you can’t find the landlord,you have to knock neighbors door ask them where’s the power switch is.we come Down and up for many times,because the wires is so weak .even we didn’t use any electrical device.we turned off all appliances ,shut down the washing machine,stove,even lamps.i have to pipe off the water by hand in the cold winter night because my clothes is m.the room provide heater,but you can’t use because of power failure. -at least there’s no WiFi working in two days.no body come to solve it.after two days later. -furniture is poor .door is fragile with a loose lock which is falling down.cabinet is lack of a door.plug is loose.lamp is broken. -no rolling paper in toilet -the rest is good. 2.About the landlord -normally you can’t find him.even in some emergency case,you still can’t find him -normally he is kind .but he shouted to me in phone with many Fu*k. -especially reminds to foreign travelers .you have to be aware,The landlord only love is money.;10
805;70;2019-12-01;367;Comodo appoggio in stanza privata;10
806;70;2020-03-01;368;The place is located in good location;8
807;70;2021-02-24;369;The rooms were clean, very comfortable, and Davide, the Host was amazing. He went over and beyond to help make my stay fun. I highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Milan.;10
808;70;2021-02-28;370;The apartment of David is perfect. With beautiful decoration and fancy style，I enjoy myself a lot！ And David is always responsible and reliable！ Recommend this room strongly！;10
809;70;2021-06-07;371;It was really easy to communicate with Davide. Sadly there was one guy in the apartment which was really dirty. Even though Davide was not in town he tried everything with a whatsapp group to get him clean his stuff. I can really recommend this apartment when you don't have a problem if there are 3 other people with you staying. Also the place is a little bit out of town but you are really fast at navigli which is one of the most popular places in Milano. Many Groceries are also close to the apartment.;9
810;70;2021-07-31;372;Top host! Great flatmates and everything in order;10
811;70;2022-08-31;373;La casa era molto sporca il materasso in pessime condizioni e la rete aveva le doghe rotte.Quando ho fatto presente queste cose all' host ha avuto il coraggio di dirmi che avevo pagato poco(590 euro). L'annuncio diceva che avrei Condiviso il bagno con una sola persona ma in casa eravamo in 4.Ragnatele e muffa alle pareti polvere e peli ovunque.L'host ha preteso che pulissi la sporcizia accumulata precedente al mio arrivo altrimenti mi avrebbe cacciato.;10
812;70;2022-12-04;374;well located place, clean and quiet and the host was very nice highly recommended;9
813;71;2019-12-29;375;Sabrina’s flexibility and hospitality were excellent. This was our first time to Italy and we ended up in a spot with easy and quick access to various parts of downtown. She provided several suggestions on areas to explore and how to use local transportation. Would highly recommend and hope we can come back!;7
814;71;2020-08-30;376;A fantastic place that feels very homely. We loved our stay and Sabrina was very accommodating.;8

818;71;2021-05-31;380;We stayed for two months at Sabrina's apartment. It was amazing -the terrace is even better than what you see in the photos- and she's an incredible host, always ready to help and give guidance on the neighborhood, Milan etc. The apartment is walking distance to the main restaurants and bars in isola, which makes it great. Totally recommended!;8
819;71;2021-08-02;381;The apartment is amazing. It’s large, spacious and has an amazingly comfortable terrace! Cleanliness and location are the best.

Sabrina was very helpful and even made sure we had some staples in the kitchen (wine, being 1, of course!) the best part are the terraces with all of Sabrina’s beautiful plants. I truly hope we can come again!;10

831;72;2020-12-27;393;I stayed with a friend and her little kid in the apartment of Giovanni for 4 nights. The place is very stylish, it really has its own character. Everything is as described, the space is sparkling clean and it has everything necessary for a very comfortable stay. The position is great, few meters from the metro station and at walking distance form the center. Despite being in busy area full of shops and restaurants, the apartment is very quiet, since it is in an internal court, overlooking a very nice garden. Communication with Giovanni and his wife was very smooth. They are very friendly, they welcomed me to give me some tips, and they left cookies and coffee for our breakfast. Highly recommended.;10
832;72;2021-01-03;394;Mooi appartement, net buiten het drukke centrum, in nabijheid van metro-, tram- en bushalte. En vlakbij winkels en cafeetjes.;9

For me, as a person who visited Milan for the first time, I was able all the necessary facilities nearby as well as to go to the city center either by a subway or even walking. Also, the apartment was filled with all possible appliances. Giovanni is a great host. Not only was he very responsive and quick in replying on messages, but also gave a lot of very useful hints and insides upon our arrival during check-in which helped us spent a very good time in Milan.;10
839;72;2021-10-13;401;una casa davvero accogliente e curata, in cui non manca nulla e in una zona bellissima e centrale della città. Una chicca della vecchia Milano con i suoi cortili segreti, ma i tutti comfort della vita moderna. Posizione strategica, vicino alla metro, e appartamento silenzioso. Host sempre disponibile e premuroso.;9
840;72;2021-11-10;402;Alloggio situato in elegante zona , comodo ai mezzi pubblici e molto vicino a tutti i luoghi di interesse. L'appartamento è accogliente e dotato di tutti i comfort. Giovanni è stato disponibile e molto cordiale.;10
841;72;2021-11-25;403;The apartment was a stylish and cozy place located in a quiet neighborhood. Giovanni was a great host and was very helpful. Highly recommended!;10
842;72;2021-12-27;404;Graziosissimo appartamento in ottima zona, perfetto punto di soggiorno per godere della molteplicità di offerte che Milano offre;8
843;72;2022-01-02;405;A very stylish apartment close to the metro, great value. It has all the amenities you’ll need and even more.;10
844;72;2022-02-11;406;Great location, great hospitality. Everything was easy with Giovanni.;10
845;72;2022-06-10;407;La casa di Giovanni è molto confortevole e silenziosa ottima per rilassarsi dopo una giornata intera passata al salone del mobile e fuori salone. Ha una posizione ideale per andare a Rho fiera attraverso la metro che si trova a 5 minuti a piedi. La zona poi è molto elegante e silenziosa oltre ad avere un teatro una libreria un supermercato a pochi passi da essa. La consiglio vivamente!! Inoltre nota positiva Giovanni è una persona super attenta e molto disponibile e comunicativa. Alla prossima !! L;10
846;73;2021-10-05;215;房东人很好、房间干净、设施齐全、可以煮饭、交通方便、到地铁站和米里都步行五分钟;10
847;73;2022-04-10;408;Rosario is a very friendly man. Even though we were sharing the space we barely met, since we had very different daily rhythms. He left when I slept and I came home when he slept. But it was never a problem. Communication was good. The place was no surprise, everything as expected. ;10
848;73;2022-04-12;409;Full of hospitality. I had a wonderful time with Rosario. The room is clean and comfortable!　;9
849;73;2022-04-14;410;"Molto spesso in un Airbnb dopo il check-in non hai più a che fare con l'host (a volte hai da fare tu, a volte ha da fare lui), ma in questo caso io e Rosario abbiamo avuto occasione di chiacchierare e di cenare insieme. E' una persona molto curiosa e interessante; è stato in moltissimi posti dove vanno in pochi (Taiwan, ad esempio); è un vero viaggiatore. Con me è stato estremamente cortese e disponibile, e condividere lo spazio non è stato affatto un problema. La casa corrispondeva alla descrizione, molto pulita (e con eccellenti profumi per l'ambiente) e nel suo piccolo confortevole e accogliente: consiglio vivamente sia il posto per dormire, sia, se ne avete la possibilità, la compagnia di Rosario.";8
850;74;2022-09-09;411;La casa, nonostante le ridotte dimensioni, è accogliente e dotata dei comfort necessari (aria condizionata, wi-fi, tv). Anche la posizione è buona, essendo abbastanza vicina al centro e a dieci minuti di cammino dalla zona Tortona e dall'università Bocconi. Ideale per brevi soggiorni (lavoro, fiere, eventi). >;10
851;75;2022-06-18;412;Lovely stay in a big studio apartment, fantastic location would highly recommend. Good communication throughout;10
852;75;2022-07-01;413;Lelio's apartment is in a fantastic location. You can easily walk to Pinacoteca di Brera, Teatro la Scala, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, and the Duomo (they're more or less in a row) in a total of 20 minutes. The neighbourhood was lovely and had plenty of restaurants, grocery stores, gelaterie, and more. The building itself is beautiful and the apartment was comfortable!;10
853;75;2022-07-04;414;Fair price for a clean room that is situated in a good location that it close to the city center.;10
854;76;2022-07-24;415;Departamento realmente excelente. Una ubicación privilegiada y con un barrio precioso y vivo alrededor. La gestión fue increíble y Lelio respondía rápidamente cuando le contacté. La portera también es muy gentil y el apartamento bien mantenido. Sin duda volvería a hospedarme allí.;10
855;76;2022-07-27;416;Great location and good communication with the host.;9
856;76;2022-08-03;417;Great location! Nice neighborhood and close to everything;10
857;76;2022-08-06;418;Decepcionante. Para subir al cuarto el ascensor estaba en el segundo nivel, había una lagartija (tengo fotos), además tela de arañas a montones, por el costo me pareció bien alto y no es como la foto lo muestra. Manija de puerta salida. Tazas sucias. Falta de seriedad del propietario.;10
858;76;2022-08-09;419;Amazing location with a short walking distance to everything you'd want to see in Milan. Lelio was amazing and really helped us with every step of the process, and was easy to contact, would highly recommend. Big thanks to Assunta and Sahani also 😊;8
859;76;2022-08-14;420;A casa tem uma localização incrível e também é ótima quanto a instalação! O lelio é incrível!! Me ligou para dar dicas do que fazer e fui super bem recebida. Recomendo muito a hospedagem;10
860;76;2022-09-07;421;Lelio’s place is very centrally located, with parking spots right in front of the apartment (payed parking ~25€/day). I definitely recommend this place, apartment dimension is modest, but there’s anything you need if you’re traveling on a budget. It also has a piano that you can use. Lelio’s is very fast in answering any question you may have, so make sure you communicate with him if something is not working as expected, he’ll go above an beyond for fixing it.;10
861;76;2022-09-11;422;Lelio's place is in a great location! Clean, safe, and near so many bars and restaurants! It's about 15 min walk to Duomo, 15 min walk to Sforza castle, and about 25 min walk to Naviglio! Communication was fabulous and I will recommend to stay here!!;10
862;76;2022-09-15;423;Lelio’s place was great - clean, with good amenities and in a terrific location - I was pleasantly surprised in the morning when I walked out to be greeted by local markets. There is also a great shopping district nearby. The housekeeper was terrific and the checkin process easy. Will definitely return when I visit Milan again.;7
863;76;2022-09-22;424;A brilliant location that is walking distance from the major sites of Milan. Better still, the host Lelio is extremely knowledgeable about Milan's history and architecture and gave me excellent tips for places to visit. The apartment contains many pieces of Lelio's artwork, which are delightful, and a piano! I hope to stay at this studio apartment again in the future.;10
864;76;2022-09-24;425;Loved staying here! Lelio’s place is located in a magnificent old apartment building and the studio itself has a lot of personality. Location also great.;8
865;76;2022-09-25;426;I Lelio communicated with me really well and was very involved in accommodating my request to get the keys early, before check-in time.;10
866;76;2022-10-02;427;Lelio nous a recommandé d'excellents restaurants et a été tres accueillant et réactif ! L'appartement est très bien placé et le lit est... Merveilleusement douillet !;10
867;76;2022-10-05;428;Great location and Lelio communicated really well and helped out with everything. I had a lovely stay.;9
868;76;2022-10-07;429;Lelio himself was very nice and communicative and even let us check in early! It was a small little space that had a full kitchen and things to use for cooking/living. It felt very safe because there was a front gate, however the door to the room itself seemed alittle unsafe because the door handle was broken and there was also a crack in the door that someone could possibly peek through if they wanted to. When we got to the front concierge there was a lady speaking to the concierge lady for about 20 minutes with us standing there waiting behind her. It seemed maybe they were friends or something because it was a very casual seeming conversation and they had complete disregard we were there. But we waited patiently without asking anything. When she finally left, it was difficult to communicate with the front desk concierge as we clearly did not speak any Italian and was using g***** translate yet she kept speaking Italian to us as if we would understand the more she spoke. Lelio had messaged me that he told the front concierge we would be there earlier but it seemed she had no idea and was telling us to come back at 2 which is fine because I understand that’s check in time. So I asked if it’s possible to just drop off our bags as Lelio mentioned we could if they weren’t done cleaning and she didn’t seem too happy about that. Eventually she said she’ll take us upstairs to drop our bags and as we were going up she told us that it’s fine we can just stay. When we went in it seemed the place was already clean and ready so I don’t know why that was such an issue. Anyways this place is great if you’re on a budget and just need a quick place to stay. We were only staying for one night passing through to get to Venice it was good enough for that. You may also need to walk a little further to find a market as there’s more retail stores around there than anything. There’s also farmers market on every Thursday and we happened to be there they sold alot of fresh food and little clothing shops. Metro and bus stops are close by too. Thank you Lelio!;10
869;76;2022-10-08;50;This apartment is clean, well-stocked, and in a great location! The host, Lelio, is very helpful and clearly wants to make your stay in Milan as fun as possible!;10
870;76;2022-10-30;51;Great place, great location, amazing host. Everything you need.;10
871;76;2022-11-02;52;Amazing communication, perfect tips on where to visit and how to get around. Would definitely recommend if you’re looking for a place to stay in Milan.;10
872;76;2022-11-11;53;Host gentile e disponibile, casa ben collocata , ben servita da trasporti con due linee metro vicine e da negozi e ristoranti. Locale silenzioso e funzionale , ben riscaldato , quartiere elegante e ben frequentato.;10
873;76;2022-11-13;54;Nice contact and nice room- recommend!;10
874;76;2022-11-21;55;Everything was amazing and the place is beautiful! Emanuele's artwork is unique and is placed around the room it's amazing! The studio is 15 minute walk to the cathedral and is so convenient!;10
875;76;2022-12-09;56;Great place, create piano, great view. Really liked the Italian market directly on the street!;10
876;76;2022-12-11;57;We flew to Milano for a piano concert and what could have been better than to have an apartment with a piano in it. Nothing better then waking up and taking a seat at the piano right away. The location is great, just a short foot walk away from everything. Restaurants and breakfast places right around the corner. Oropax we’re great for the night as it is a busy street. Thanks for the wonderful stay!;7
877;77;2019-09-19;58;Daniela è simpatica ed il locale pulito ed accogliente;8
878;77;2019-09-22;59;Daniela's place was perfect. Well lit, clean and peaceful. Daniela was an amazing host and not only did she let me check in early, she was also extremely helpful with trying to book stuff for me and made sure I had anything I required. This is the best air bnb experience I've had and I would highly recommend that given the chance you stay at Daniela's.;10
879;77;2022-06-07;60;We very much enjoyed our stay!;9
880;77;2022-06-14;61;Nice place！;10
881;77;2022-06-18;62;Very nicely located neat flat. Daniela is a Great host.;10
882;77;2022-06-22;63;She was really nice. The place was as shown in the picture specifically the washroom. She gave light breakfast everyday. You will find almost everything here. The bus stop is very close 2 min walk. From the bus stop you can take 92 bus to Loreto from Loreto take the train to Duomo. The room was a bit small and not much ventilated, there is a window but it was very hot. She gave ventilator but it was not that powerful. It was very hot in the room. If you are going in summers, it could be a problem. But in other seasons this place is perfect. There is a tram station too 6 min too directly to Duomo, but it will take 40 mins through that. She also offered a lot of juices which were kept in the refrigerator. She is a nice person. Bathroom had Jacuzzi and is really beautiful and well maintained, was cleaned everyday.;10
883;77;2022-06-25;64;Comparable to a 5-star hotel. Daniela is a lovely person, we loved our stay at ther flat.;10
884;77;2022-07-06;65;She is the best . I hope to see you again;10
885;77;2022-07-10;66;L’appartamento è semplicemente stupendo, accogliente, elegante e raffinato, così come anche Daniela, sempre molto disponibile e gentile. Ci tornerò sicuramente!;7
886;77;2022-07-13;67;Extremely cosy accomodation with luxurious interiors and amenities. very good location where everything was in reach;9
887;77;2022-07-17;68;The apartment was very big and looked like on the photos. The neighborhood is very cute, with a very famous and nice bar just around the corner and also nice eating options. Bus and metro station are not far away. Daniela was a very friendly host, always ready with advice.;10
888;77;2022-07-21;69;Ho alloggiato da Daniela pochi giorni per conseguire una tesi laurea, mi sono trovato subito a mio agio per i confort offerti ma soprattutto per l’accoglienza ricevuta dalla proprietaria, spontanea, solare e di una gentilezza rara.;8
889;77;2022-09-13;70;"Really nice place close to the center of Milano; with Daniela being a friendly and great host. Good experience in Milano.";10
890;78;2020-04-13;295;très bon séjour dans un bel appartement et une très bonne situation.;10
891;78;2020-04-18;71;Gracie Claudia, tutto perfetto. :-) The apartment was perfect for our stay in Milan.;10
892;78;2020-07-13;72;This is very nice apartment, but quite small. Perfect for one or for two person. Situated on first floor, so there is no balcony at all. Apartment close to metro station and tram station. Very good location:15 min by walk to the city center and just 3 station by metro. My favorite leaving area in Milan. I recommend! ;10
893;78;2020-07-22;73;Apartamento molto ben ubicato. Claudia e' molto gentile.;7
894;78;2021-04-19;74;The apartment was a good place to stay during the Salone del Mobile, but is on the small side so no comfy chairs or sofas to relax in. It has an efficient hidden kitchenette, plus good storage to keep your clothes and luggage out of the way. Claudia and her associate Lorenzo were very helpful before and during my stay. It’s a few blocks from the metro station which is very convenient, but situated off on a quiet side street in a safe area with a doorman during the daytime. The only issue with this apartment is that it’s located close to the lobby in the building so it can be a little noisy with people coming and going.;10
895;78;2021-09-07;75;Unfortunately, this was the first deceiving experience using the AirBNB platform. Our reservation was changed by the host 24 hours before our arrival. The proposed alternative was not convenient to us and our demand to cancel the booking was not accepted. The host said it was not possible for her to cancel and placed us in another location which was substantially farer than the chosen one. This is to our knowledge against the AIRBNB rules. Having no other choice, we accepted the alternative proposal. Arriving to the indicated new location, we had to wait one hour in front of the building according to the agreed meeting time. The apartment was way below our expectations: no AC, the fridge wasn't clean, lock of main door in bad conditions, no soap nor toilet paper in the bathroom, poor kitchen equipment (no pans, not even a simple Italian coffee maker!), towel with weird yellow stains, etc. To our understanding and according to previous experiences, this was not at all to meet AIRBNB standards. We definitely do not recommend the owner or the apartment for AIRBNB clients.;10
896;78;2022-06-08;76;Not a good experience at all. I was last minute moved to a worse location into a shared apartment with one bathroom , even though I was to the new place a much better and bigger apartment. Seems very opportunistic given the extreme low availability during Milan Design Week. I would not recommend.;9
897;79;2020-11-29;77;It is clean and wide house. The host is very kind. There are very delicious restaurants and supermarkets around so you can enjoy the beautiful city of Milan. I will absolutely stay this house next time!;10
898;79;2021-01-02;78;Claudia was extremely welcoming and sweet. Claudia’s flat is very well located close to navigli and the city center. Her flat is very quiet and charming. We definitely hope to be back to Claudia’s flat for our next trip in Milan;10
899;79;2021-02-25;79;Sono stato nella casa di Claudia per 4 notti e mi sono sentito subito come a casa. La posizione è meravigliosa e la casa é stupenda. Claudia ti accoglie con grande gentilezza e si mette a disposizione per qualsiasi problema o dubbio. Sono davvero felice di aver trovato questa sistemazione. Quando tornerò a Milano sarà sicuramente la mia prima scelta. Davvero consigliata;8
900;79;2021-03-06;80;Wonderful hospitality and a very good space and location. Thank you.;10
901;79;2021-09-24;81;Really amazing place to stay, Claudia was very helpful. Clean, cosy, very close to the centre! This place is everything you need! Highly recommended!;7
902;79;2021-11-05;82;Abbiamo soggiornato in questo appartamento per quasi un mese, data la vicinanza con il nostro luogo di lavoro. Claudia si è dimostrata da subito disponibilissima a gestire la nostra presenza e le nostre necessità. Con attenzione e cura ai dettagli, si è distinta particolarmente facendoci vivere una piacevole esperienza in una delle zone più centrali di Milano. La location è comoda perché in pochi minuti si arriva ai Navigli, dove la vita notturna è ricca ma nonostante questo l'appartamento è silenzioso e accogliente. Claudia è stata una perfetta padrona di casa!;10
903;79;2021-12-08;83;Ho alloggiato nell’appartamento di Claudia per quasi mese ed è stato come aver avuto una seconda casa. Ambiente super accogliente, in pieno centro città, con un servizio di pulizia impeccabile (Nelka, la signora delle pulizie, è una persona gentilissima) Claudia è un’host perfetta oltre ad essere una bellissima persona. Assolutamente consigliato!;9
904;79;2022-04-13;84;Claudia è molto premurosa per poter agevolare al massimo gli ospiti. L' appartamento è pulito e si hanno a disposizione tutti i servizi. La location è ottima in quanto molto vicina ai navigli ed anche molto comoda per la fruizione dei mezzi pubblici.;10
905;79;2022-07-30;85;Recomiendo 100% el departamento! Claudia es una excelente anfitriona, y el departamento fue perfecto para mi: lindo, bien ubicado, limpio, con todas las comodidades que necesité! Gracias Claudia por tu hospitalidad!;9
906;80;2021-04-15;86;Casa molto bella e comoda, grazie, Silvia!;10
907;80;2021-11-14;87;Silvia’s flat is the perfect base to explore Milan, whether one is there on holidays or on business. The metro (2 lines) as well as several bus-lines are literally at your doorstep. The apartment itself is amazing: Very quiet for its central location, super bright and spacious on the 5th and last floor. It is colorful and airy and full of lovely details. Silvia is a product designer and her very good taste can be seen throughout the flat. We stayed at her place for 4 weeks while apartment hunting in Milan for my daughter who’s studying there. We couldn’t have felt more at home. Check in/ check out/responsiveness & flexibility were all top! We can only strongly recommend to stay at Silvia’s flat while in Milan. We will definitely be back.;10
908;80;2022-03-25;88;Silvia is a fantastic host, ver easy communication, and the apartment is beautiful, filled with light, and has everything you could ever need! One of my best AirBnB experiences ever.;10
909;80;2022-06-15;89;You'll love Silvia's flat. It's full of light and fun details that make your stay very enjoyable and comfortable. The location is ideal, it's a short walk to central station and local trains. The grocery store is across the street and a pharmacy is just downstairs. We would definitely recommend to everyone.;8
910;80;2022-07-04;151;Koselig, personlig og stilfull leilighet med god sentral beliggenhet. Ligger nærme Metro og masse butikker. Matbutikk rett over gaten. Har ikke aircondition, vær obs på dette på varme dager.;10
911;80;2022-08-14;89;Perfect location for a stay in Milan. Great restaurants and shops in the area, a grocery store and pharmacy next door, and two metro stations nearby. The apartment was clean, bright, comfortable, and we were provided with all of the essentials. Thank you Silvia for a wonderful stay!;7

913;80;2022-09-11;91;Absolutely amazing place with lots of practical things one needs when traveling. Place was super clean and had so many little things to make our stay comfortable. Silvia was so polite and kind. Gave us lots of advice and always took our call when we needed help. I would definitely stay there again.;10
914;80;2022-09-21;92;Excelente departamento muy bien ubicado cerca de Estación Central. Hay un supermercado al frente, una farmacia a lado, la parada del metro a una cuadra y restaurantes también cerca. La anfitriona es lo mejor. Muy jovial, disponible y atenta. Gracias Silvia.;9

916;80;2022-10-31;94;Utilizamos el apartamento de Silvia por un mes y estuvimos realmente cómodas. Silvia es una persona muy amable y siempre estuvo pendiente de todo, respondiendo rápidamente a cualquier solicitud. El apartamento es amplio, muy claro y confortable, bien equipado tal como se ve en las fotos. Esta situado a pocos metros de la estación de metro de Loreto, en un sector de fácil acceso para movilizarse con comercio y supermercado a un paso. Lo recomendamos para pasar varios días en Milan y espero podernos hospedar nuevamente allá. Gracias Silvia!;8

I will definitively recommand this flat, I am not sure there is better flat in Milano.;8
931;81;2022-10-23;109;Ilaria's home was conveniently located in the center of everything! Accessible by foot to tons of shops and the duomo.

938;82;2021-06-29;116;Сильвия прекрасный хост, все рассказала и показала. Комната хорошая. Место отличное, рядом можно найти пару ресторанов без туристов с настоящей итальянской едой. Обязательно нужно сходить в парк к северу от жилья, там прекрасная природа и можно отдохнуть после центра Милана. Всем советую это жильё.;10
939;82;2021-07-18;117;Extremely beautiful apartment near to the city center and a very easy-going, kind family with cute cats :) Sylvia was helpful, we could communicate easily. Our room was beautiful and comfortable and we also had a seperate bathroom. We really enjoyed our stay here!;10
940;82;2021-07-20;118;The best by far experienced that i had in airbnb!! Recommend 100%!!;10
941;82;2021-07-23;119;Very nice place, very friendly host, it takes ~40mins to the center but has a very good bus and metro connection. Thanks for having us!;10
942;82;2021-07-26;120;Nice and comfortable staying. Also a nice and friendly host!;8
943;82;2021-07-28;121;Flat was clean and nice. We was confused from information about adress. She was nice but communication was worse. Time of arrival which we agreed, wasnt respected and we waited long time.;10
944;82;2021-08-03;122;Das kleine Zimmer liegt im 8 Stock in einer Wohnsiedlung. Alles ist sehr sauber, die leute sind nett und das wohl wichtigste, man kommt sehr schnell ins Zentrum der bildschönen Stadt Mailand Immer wieder gern;10

946;82;2021-09-05;124;"Bardzo udany pobyt;) Sylwia posiada bardzo duże mieszkanie z ogromnym tarasem. Polecam";7
947;82;2021-09-09;125;Spędziłyśmy z mamą świetny czas w Mediolanie a mieszkanie Sylvii było bardzo dobrym wyborem. Zostałyśmy bardzo miło ugoszczone. Mieszkanie jest bardzo duże, posiada ogromny taras i znajduje się w super okolicy, ok. 40min od centrum, ale komunikacja jest bezproblemowa. Polecam serdecznie.;9
948;82;2021-09-14;126;It was absolutely pleasant stay, thank you so much! Silvia is a great host, all the family is very friendly and helpful. Our room was cozy and clean, with really stylish bathroom! The view from the terrace is simply wonderful. And last, but not the least - cats, they are awesome :) Thank you very much for everything, it was truly amazing time!;8
949;82;2021-09-21;127;Очень необычная по планировке квартира с огромной терассой. Хозяйка приветливая и очень проста в общении, что-то узнать про город или про что-нибудь договориться не будет проблемой, хорошо понимает по английски. Комната небольшая, с разложенным диваном практически не остаётся места, но переспать пару ночей - самое то. В квартире 3 кота - один ласковый, другой трусливый, а третий очень любопытный и бродит за вами везде по пятам;10
950;82;2021-09-28;128;Сказать,что мы остались в восторге,значит ничего не сказать! Сильвия восхитительная!Гостреприимная,такая светящаяся! Дом очень красивый,интерьер и терраса никого не оставит равнодушным! Комната небольшая,но очень уютная,в конце сентября тепло было даже без отопления и толстых одеял.Очень красивая и довольно функциональная уборная,есть все необходимое) Ах,да,и кошки!Мы таких ласковых,мурчащих как тракторы,кошек в жизни не видели! Спасибо большое Сильвии!Мы влюбились в Милан,в нее саму и ее дом! Обязательно вернемся!;10
951;82;2021-10-05;129;Perfetti padroni di casa. Disponibili a venire incontro alle richieste degli ospitati. Nessuna brutta sorpresa.;10
952;82;2021-10-06;239;房子很漂亮，就是位置Google不太准，坐地铁要小心M1会分叉成两个目的地，上车前看清楚目的地再坐，车的侧面会有，总的来说房子很棒，住的那个房间有点小，不过很划算，只是睡一觉，离中央车站有点距离，不建议自由行住这里;10
953;82;2021-10-11;130;Great house and lovely family!;10
954;82;2021-10-16;131;La lop;10
955;82;2021-10-20;132;Ότι περιγράφεται, αυτό συνάντησα. Ευχαριστημένος σε όλα. Περίπου ένα 20λεπτο -χωρίς τις αναμονές- με την συγκοινωνία για το duomo. Το μόνο που θα επισημάνω για καλύτερα είναι ότι δεν υπήρχε ούτε ένα συρτάρι να βάλουμε κάποιο ρούχο.;7
956;82;2021-11-11;133;Silvia è stata molto disponibile a venirci incontro con i nostri orari e la casa pulita e tutto il necessario a nostra disposizione. Ottima posizione e ben collegata, attraverso i mezzi con il centro. Molto consigliato;9
957;82;2021-11-14;134;The place is amasing! Everything was as described: spacious flat with huge balcony, very tidy and clean. Room was exceptionally cozy with separate bathroom. Host was very helpful and friendly. Her hospitality is on the highest level. I will definetly recommend this place to visit.;10
958;82;2021-11-25;403;Прекрасный вариант .Осталось такое впечатление что жила у друзей с которыми давно не виделись. Современный итальянский район до метро 10 минут через парк , ухоженная территория.Квартира с современным дизайном и как бонус 100м2 терраса на 8 этаже с видом на парк. Очень гостеприимные хозяева.;10
959;82;2022-06-07;135;Host molto gentile e accogliente, ti senti come a casa. Presente un terrazzo molto grande, camera e bagno molto puliti e funzionali. Consigliatissimo!;10
960;82;2022-06-08;136;Ho capito sin da subito che Silvia é una bella persona. Mi sono trovato benissimo. Consigliato;10
961;82;2022-06-11;137;This stay is perfect. Very nice neighbourhood, walking to the appartement tower is through a serene park with birds chirping here and there. The concierge is very helpful and speaks German and Italian and a little English. The appartement is very personalised which I really appreciate. You get your own bathroom and you can take a bath if you want. They have a rooftop terrace which gives a great view and space for sunbathing. They are flexible, not being bothered by my late nights out in the city and coming home around 5AM. Also AC is available in your room. The appartement is well reached by public transport, taking only 25 minutes to get to Duomo Would recommend very much, my only downside is the pillow being a little flat. But I guess that comes down to taste.;7
962;82;2022-06-12;138;La casa si trova in un'oasi verde, un posto tranquillo e riservato, a 50 m dalla fermata dell'autobus e 10 min di camminata dalla stazione di metrò. La camera e tutta la casa sono arredate con gusto ed eleganza. Una menzione speciale per le pulizie. Ho apprezzato la compagnia degli amici a quattro zampe della padrona che mi ha dato l'impressione di una persona positiva e solare. È stata una bella esperienza.;10
963;82;2022-06-22;139;Alloggiare da Silvia è stata una fortuna! Lei e le sue ragazze sono state gentilissime e non mi hanno fatto mancare niente...anzi! Stanza e bagno privato molto puliti, ambiente amichevole e positivo. Un'esperienza perfetta.;8
964;82;2022-08-29;140;Silvia was very helpful and explained everything I needed to know. She replied fastly and everytime I needed something so communication with her was very easy. She even let me stay at the flat until afternoon of day the leaving. The flat was really beautiful and I felt comfortable.;10
965;82;2022-09-08;141;a fantastic experience! thanks a lot!;10
966;82;2022-09-11;142;Silvia was a very good host who communicated everything clearly, and the apartment was clean, nicely decorated, and in a handy location.;10
967;82;2022-11-30;144;"Ottima esperienza, abitazione elegante, confortevole e vissuta con ""personalità"", la stessa che Silvia riesce a trasmettere spontaneamente con la sua accoglienza e cordialità";9
968;82;2022-12-03;145;Grazie per l’ospitalità e la simpatia!;10
969;83;2021-04-07;146;The host Jacopo is friendly, sincere and helpful. He is clear in communication via whatsapp and you can ask him Qs anytime. The place is clean and purposeful. He provides clean towels and you can use the kitchen to make a drink or warm up food in the microwave. There is hot water to bathe and wifi to use. The train station Piola (green line) is about 300m away which is very convenient.;10
970;83;2021-04-09;147;Nice and lovely flat . Very bright and clean and Jacobo was doing his best that everything is perfect ;7
971;83;2021-09-20;148;Clean and cozy place near Politecnico.;10
972;83;2021-09-25;149;We had a great stay at Jacopo's place. The subway is nearby and we liked the small balcony. Recommended!;8
973;83;2021-10-22;150;Jacopo est très accueillant il nous a tout montré très bonne organisation chambre très propre et ensoleillé endroit calme et tranquille;8
974;83;2021-11-14;151;I am very happy with everything, the apartment is decorated in a wonderfully creative manner and all (Jacopo, his dad and his flatmates) were very friendly. For me personally the bed was somehow too hard but it was good for my boyfriend. I can absolutely recommend it. Of course the location is excellent as well.;10
975;83;2021-01-03;152;Camera carina e pulita, il propriotario è stato molto gentile! La casa è molto vicino alla stazione metropolitana.;10
976;83;2021-01-22;153;Very good;10
977;83;2021-02-26;154;Jacopo is a very nice and responsive host. He communicates well and ensure the guests are well taken care of! The room is nice and cosy, with a location near the university and near central station as well. Did not manage to see Jacopo but his mother was there to welcome us and inform us of the necessary procedures. It was a very enjoyable stay!;9
978;83;2021-03-22;155;Nice place, great location. Jacopo is a good host. The shower could be improved.;10
979;83;2021-04-13;156;"If you’re looking for a homely stay in Milan, pls check out Jacopo’s Apartment. Located on the 4th floor of this gated residence, you take the cute vintage lift where you have to manually close the doors :) When you arrive, Jacopo’s apartment has a homely vibe. The main bedroom is huge, offering views of the quiet suburban estate where Piola metro is just 250m away. The room is bright, airy and functional; the sheets are clean and the host provides fresh face and body towels. You can use the kitchen to boil water to make a drink. Jacopo also cleared fridge space for me to store drinks and fruits. He is attentive to guest’s needs and is only a whatsapp message away if you have questions. I recommend staying at this flat if you’re in Milan for leisure or work.";10
980;83;2021-12-07;157;We had a lovely stay at jacopo’s place even though he wasn’t present he kept me informed with details and was very quick to respond, his mother was the one to hand the keys who was very sweet and helpful we had a lovely stay would definitely recommend;7
981;83;2022-06-09;158;Ottima posizione, bella camera, letto comodo, due giorni piacevoli;10
982;83;2022-06-12;159;Jacopo is a great host and very accommodating. The room and bathroom are very spacious. Great communication and punctuality;8
983;84;2022-07-01;160;Awesome beautiful place, would definitely book again.;10
984;85;2022-07-16;161;Adele's house is located on a separate island, the environment is very beautiful, the kitchen is very complete, we spent a happy holiday on the island.;10
985;85;2022-07-30;162;What a stunning location! Superb little place with everything you need to have a great time! Adele was a fab host and I would highly recommend the island to anyone!;10
986;85;2022-08-30;163;Really great and unique place to stay. Highly recommend it and we will definitely be back!;9
987;85;2022-12-28;164;Lovely views and all mod cons. We had a lovely BBQ and everything we needed was in the kitchen.;10
988;85;2023-03-05;165;A truly magical and very unique place to stay and a wonderful host. if you want to switch off and recharge this is the place. utterly beautiful. Thank you Adele;9
989;86;2022-07-30;166;"Adele was an attentive and thorough host who responded well to all queries ahead of our trip.

The space itself is fantastic with all the amenities listed fully living up to the photos shown. The outdoor space is also fantastic and access to the river just a short walk down from the house.

Overall a great trip and much appreciated by all the guests for the weekend!";10
990;86;2022-08-24;167;We had a fantastic stay at Hermitage house. The house was exactly like the photographs, we wouldn’t of changed a thing. Would definitely recommend to friends and family.;7
991;86;2022-09-02;168;This is an excellent house in a fantastic location with everything you could need and more. Jerry was super helpful from start to finish. We had the best weekend at Hermitage House and will definitely be back. Thanks Adele!;9
992;86;2022-09-16;169;"UNBELIEVABLE! OUTSTANDING !

Look no further if you have a large party, this house has it all! stunning ground, tons to do and Adele is friendly and responsive throughout!

will definitely be returning!";9
993;86;2022-11-30;170;"We had a fantastic 2 night stay in the beautiful Hermitage House for a Hen Party. Adele was a fantastic host who would respond promptly to any questions I had before our stay and during, he was flexible on our arrival time and gave detailed information about the house, getting to it and getting inside before our arrival.
The house it’s self is a spacious building that was great for us to gather round together and eat as a large group, it offers so many things to do whilst there, we didn’t want to leave! Everyone enjoyed using the equipment such as pool tables, casino tables, hot tub etc. the house is situated on its own grounds so great for a little walk.
Everything was well presented in the house with lots of needed items such as toilet rolls, washing up liquid and more, but the extra special touch was each person their bed had 3 folded towels with individual toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo, body wash and moisturiser.
We can’t wait for a reason to book to go again!";10
994;86;2022-12-30;171;Great stay at Hermitage house in Lancashire. We went for a family get away 14 adults and 5 kids and there was plenty of space for us all! After the booking Adele sent a very useful 3D floor plan so we could organise ourselves prior. We spent most of our time in the kitchen which is where the 'casino' tables are it's such a great space! Whilst the kids entertained themselves in the cinema which is the next room from the kitchen. I wish I could've stayed for longer. The house is so big I would warn you to take care of personal belongings because it's easy to 'lose' it and the cleaners won't be able to find it. There's morecombe bay nearby and lots of shops 15 mins drive if you want to do a big shop. We went to Pendle Witch pub for a meal which I'd recommend. The hot tub was brilliant, absolutely huge! The sauna was a nice touch especially in the cold British weather. All in all, I would definitely stay again i just wouldn't take any jewellery with me. Thanks Adele!;10
995;86;2023-02-20;172;A fabulous stay, perfect for large parties and stunningly beautiful;10
996;87;2022-06-10;173;It was amazing time for us. Home is really plushy. Antonia and Elvis gave us important tips and always was giving us help when we needed. Everything was clean and home was well equipped. We hope that we could see you in next years.;10
997;87;2022-06-22;174;"We stayed in this place as a family and really enjoyed our stay. The house is very well equipped and we lacked nothing. The pool is, of course, the absolute highlight.
Communication with the landlords also worked out great. All issues were answered quickly and competently.";8
998;87;2022-08-29;175;Die Unterkunft ist wunderschön. Sie liegt in einer ruhigen Straße. In der Nähe gibt es einen Supermarkt und lokale Marktstände, sodass man mit allem versorgt ist. Besonders hat uns der große Pool gefallen, welcher jeden Tag gesäubert wurde. Leider gibt es nur im Wohnzimmer eine Klimaanlage, sodass es nachts in den Schlafzimmern heiß wurde. Aber das sind nur kleine Anmerkungen. Insgesamt war es ein super Aufenthalt in einer schönen Unterkunft. Die Entfernung zum Meer beträgt mit dem Auto nur 15 Minuten. Weiterer Vorteil ist die Nähe zum Flughafen Zadar.;10
999;87;2022-09-08;176;The house was super secluded and very nice with the pool. We had a great time;10
1000;87;2022-09-11;177;All in all a top house, perfect for groups, modern, clean, quietly located and with a small supermarket a few minutes walk away. The landlord went out of his way and stopped by every day to check the pool.;10
1001;87;2022-11-30;178;"We felt very comfortable and had a great vacation. There was nothing missing. The house is perfectly equipped and the pool that was cleaned by Elvis is very generous. The care of Antonia and Elvis was impeccable. Our dog was also welcome.
We will be happy to come back.";7
1002;87;2022-12-03;179;"Words can't describe our stay as well as we experienced it.
Antonia was very helpful and eager and even took 2h to show us around the area and buy great tips for fresh fish and seafood.
The house was very nice, great layout, good air conditioning which was only in the living room but had good performance. In the outdoor area was a great large pool that was cleaned daily, a mighty barbecue where we were also prepared a dinner surprisingly, a stylish and beautiful roof to sit comfortably in the shade as well as a very large parking lot to arrive with several cars. The surroundings reminded us of another time as chickens were roaming freely and the neighbors all welcomed us very warmly. In the immediate vicinity is a sports field, a supermarket, a restaurant as well as a gas station and the highway. The distance to Zadar is also very good with 20 minutes. All in all, we would like to thank everyone for the great holiday and warmth. Many thanks to Antonia, Elvis, writer and Sabrina.";9
1003;88;2021-01-03;180;Very nice place. We highly recommend it! Basic and green way of living in full nature without other people or houses in the neighbourhood. There are separate sleeping units, some in adapted caravans and one in a little wooden hut ('the nest'), with a beautiful view on the lake. There is an outside (dry) toilet and shower. Theo is a very good cook. Vegetarian food. Breakfast is basic, lunch is great. For diner you get a very delicious soup. You eat together with the other guests, maximum about 10 persons. The lake is great, with soft, clean and warm water. There is a very nice little village on half an hour walking distance (Santana da Cambas). Theo is a warm and intelligent person with a interesting vision of life.;8
1004;88;2021-01-22;181;"My husband and I spent 3 nights in the island and we brought with us our spanish water dog.

The island is beautiful, full of trees, plants and many areas where to walk, or simply sit, meditate and enjoy nature. There are a couple of ponds with frogs, chickens running around, a very sociable cat, birds flying around. The water of the lake is super clean, we used the paddleboards that Theo offers to the guests and it was a great way of cooling down during the warmer hours while having fun, our dog had a lot of fun as well swimming. The food was delicious, like very delicious. Our cabin was very cozy and clean, it had amazing views to the lake and the garden, and the mosquito net made it insect free inside which is great for me as I tend to get bitten by mosquitoes very easily.

The only ""problem"" that I would say is that the dry compostable toilet is in the middle of the garden, without any walls or separation to provide some privacy (some tall bushes on the sides and the back). For me it wasn't a problem but my husband had some troubles trying to use it as he likes to be alone and closed in a toilet. Also for people with long and thick hair the water stream of the shower wouldn't probably suffice but using a bucket or something similar would solve the issue.

Overall we loved the experience and we will recommend it to our family, friends and colleagues, and I am hoping to return for more! :D";10
1005;88;2021-02-26;182;"This place is magical, a real experience into nature and beauty.
Theo is a very interesting host and cook, the food was delicious.
The views are extraordinary on turtle island and it’s a great place to swim. There is more to the place than meets the eye… excellent experience !";10
1006;88;2021-03-22;183;There are no words that reliably describe the beauty and uniqueness of this place - surrounded by nature and far away from any noise or civilization. Theo is a great host & cook and we are already planning our next trip to Ilha da Tartaruga.;10
1007;88;2021-04-13;184;"Theo is a wonderful host, I had an amazing time on the island.
Get ready to see the most beautiful sunrise. It is highly recommended to stay a few days to fully experience this unique place";10
1008;88;2021-12-07;185;This place is wonderful! The garden is beautiful and the food was great. Theo is a friendly and welcoming hosts. His place is very unique and relaxong. Will come back and enjoy a relaxong time in the hammock :);10
1009;88;2022-06-09;186;If you enjoy a stay in fantastic natural surroundings, this place should be perfect for you. Theo takes great care to minimize the environmental impact and the facilities are very simple - as accurately accounted for in the description. We ended up mostly just staying on the island, swimming in the lake, reading and not doing very much of anything at all. It should also be mentioned that Theo is an excellent cook apart from being a super pleasant and reliable host.;10
1010;88;2022-06-12;187;"There are not enough superlatives to say how I felt about turtle Island.
All I can say is if you want to get away from it all and be with a host who leaves you totally alone but will be there whenever you want him, then this is the place.
As is explained all the meals are vegetarian, what you don't get told is how great tasting they were (this is from a confirmed omnivore)
I don't want to reccomend this place too highly as I'd hate it to be fully booked when I want to go.";8
1011;89;2022-08-24;188;"First, we want to thank the hosts for a nice and remote Robinson style house. We felt peaceful and tranquil there. It felt like we were alone on a paradise island. The house was also very clean which we appreciate.
Keep in mind there are no shops on the island, so you need to come prepared with food and water for the entire duration.";9
1012;90;2022-06-28;189;Host was really friendly helpful and helped allot with recommendations. Host was available at any time of day and was always more than willing to help.;10
1013;90;2022-07-05;190;Amazing villa without any people around. Total privacy and nature. Every day we cooked seafood that i caught in front of the house - fish, crabs, oysters, mussels. Highly recommended place!;10
1014;90;2022-07-30;191;The host and his listing are awesome and we had an amazing time. This villa is located on a desolated island a less than 10 minutes boat ride from the small town Murter. On the island you will have complete peace and you can enjoy the nature. Essentials are prepared by the host side and there were some lovely welcome gifts for each of us. He showed us how to use BBQ and offered to catch the fish for the dinner if we want. Regarding electricity and water, there are some special rules in the island which are very simple to follow. Even though it is October, the weather was amazing so we were diving literally in our yard. The host is really friendly, open-minded, knows local people and proposed us several activities. I will definitely recommend this unique place to everyone.;10
1015;90;2022-08-24;192;It's an absolutely magical place. If you're looking for a slice of heaven, stop by Mladen's place. Everything has been designed so that you can experience an immersion in nature, with stunning sea views just steps away, as if this was part of your garden. The latter has multiple nooks to make the most of your stay, according to your desires. From this place that you won't want to leave, you have privileged access to the Kornati Islands, to be discovered absolutely! Mladen arranged everything for us to rent a boat with skipper who comes to pick us up directly from the private dock of the house, at a very competitive price. A great excursion! Finally, I will end with the exceptional welcome of our host, who, after serving us the glass of friendship, believed in his own making, even prepared our first meal for us on the evening of our arrival so that we had nothing to do. Then he came back the next day at noon to offer us our first BBQ and show us how the house works. Each of our family members was very attentive! Finally Mladen was very passionate about us having the most pleasant stay, not hesitating to get around if we needed service and bring fresh bread on occasion.;10
1016;90;2022-09-02;193;"Far from the hustle and bustle of the seaside towns, Mladen's home is a little hidden paradise on a small deserted island only accessible by boat. Here, time stands still. We live to the rhythm of the sun and the stars, we bathe in the sea or in the jacuzzi while admiring the blue of the Adriatic :) Here, we live outside, going from the terrace to the hammock and enjoying the mild local climate.
15 minutes by sea, is the city of Murter and its entertainment (restaurants, shops, market...). Just 30 minutes away is the Kornati Islands National Park and its secret coves where you can sail before eating a wood-fired sea bream at one of these typical waterfront restaurants.
To refuel positive energy, as a couple or family, this exceptional house is the perfect place! And places like this, there are few in the world ;)";8
1017;91;2022-06-08;194;This is truly a jewel. Highly recommended!;10
1018;91;2022-06-11;195;Unique place and house with lots of charm.;8
1019;91;2022-06-12;196;Unforgettable weekend on a paradise island. We only want to after leaving the place: come back as soon as possible!! Thank you for everything Catherine and I hope to see you soon.;10
1020;91;2022-06-22;197;A magical place for a weekend with the family;10
1021;91;2022-08-29;198;Great place, very well equipped nothing missing;10
1022;91;2022-09-08;199;An absolutely extraordinary place, space, fabulous views, an unforgettable coast and a very beautiful house, full of charm and welcoming, with plethora amenities.;9
1023;92;2022-05-30;200;We just had a superbe holliday! 5-star service by the host and family. They were so kind and helpful. The house and surroundings are like a dream if you like peace and quietness, beautiful landscapes, nature and the sea at your feets. There is even a harbour with restaurants and supermarket 20 minutes of walking away. We definitely want to get back.;10
1024;92;2022-06-10;201;Robinson holiday is located in a very nice spot with a private access to the see and a wonderful sunset in front of the house. Alexander (Sale) is a very kind person, who have been always punctual and collaborative, we definitely recommend his house. On the other side of the coin there is the lack of running water in the bathroom, you need to pull up the water from the tank manually. If you like a full immersion in the fishermen style of life, you are really in the right place.;10
1025;92;2022-06-22;202;Booké en avance et suivis et accompagnés par Sale pour nos démarches (location de bateau, permis de peche...) nous avions hate d'arriver ! le jour du rendez-vous arrive et nous rencontrons Sale et son Papa, qui nous explique la marche à suivre (récup du bateau, réserve d'essence, courses nécessaires : eau et nourriture) et nous partons sur l'ile en suivant le bateau du papa de Sale, une traversée magnifique parmi les ilots, jusqu'à l'ile de ZUT. Un coin de paradis, maison Robinson, où l'harmonie et le rythme de la nature nous gagne de jour en jour... petit quai pour garer le bateau à deux pas de la maison, coin rocheux sous les pins où nous avons établis notre camp de base pendant ces vacances, avec la canne à peche qui nous aura offert de bon repas de poissons frais... ambiance survie, meme si la maison est vraiment tout confort (wifi, frigo, cuisine équipée, panneaux solaires et toilettes à l'eau de mer !), puiser l'eau du puits pour nos besoins en eau douce, petite marche jusqu'à la marina pour le revitaillement de base, découvertes des iles, du parc de Kornati, de petites criques où tout est resté sauvage et où seules quelques maisons de pecheurs habillent le paysage... un calme absolu, relax au maximum... Sale a répondu très rapidement à nos petites questions, il a toujours été disponible et attentif. le seul point négatif que nous aurions à déclarer est le dur retour à la réalité... nous reviendons dès que l'occasion se représente !;9
1026;92;2022-08-29;203;Da wir so spontan kamen, dass wir die Überfahrt zur Insel nicht mehr am ersten gebuchten Tag machen konnten, wurde wir für eine Nacht in Murter untergebracht in einem Hotelzimmer. Dies war super freundlich und sehr entgegenkommend! Auch während unseres Aufenthaltes auf der Insel und bei den Transfers war unser Gatsgeberfamilie immer um unser Wohlergehen besorgt und kümmerte sich sehr um uns! Durch ihre herzliche Art und den familiären Umgang fühlten wir uns wohl und konnten unseren Aufenthalt sehr genießen! Wegen der Felsen am Strand empfehlen wir an Schuhe zum Baden zu denken! Wir haben unsere Tage abseits von Hektik und Trubel sehr genossen und können dies nur allen empfehlen, die gerne mal ein paar Tage weg von allem wollen und auf Computer, Fernseher, Feiern, viele Menschen und dergleichen verzichten um mit sich, Familie oder Partner alleine zu sein und zu klaren Gedanken zu kommen, miteinander Zeit zu verbringen oder mit einem guten Buch in der Sonne zu entspannen.;10
1027;92;2022-09-08;204;"Ein wunderbares Haus, traumhafte Lage und supernette Leute ergaben einen perfekten Urlaub!
DANKE, es gibt keinen Grund nicht wieder zu kommen :)";8
1028;93;2022-06-07;205;The place was very pretty with great views from around the island. Very peaceful we enjoyed it very much even in November and even the rain dried quickly. Aline met us and showed us round and was very helpful. I imagine the place would be spectacular in the summer as it was really pretty even in this time of year.;8
1029;93;2022-06-08;206;This is a really special and beautiful place. Surrounded by the river, trees and many wonderful birds we had such a relaxing stay. The cottage is well equipped and homely and it was great to be able to borrow the bicycles and stand up paddle boards. Aline is so helpful and welcoming. We thoroughly recommend staying in this idyllic setting.;10
1030;93;2022-06-11;207;"What an idyllic place to stay, the island is stunning. The house was clean & comfortable, it had everything we could've needed. Having access to the games room, kayaks & bikes was so great, we had so much fun. I wish we could've stayed for longer!

Thankyou Aline!!! ☺️";10
1031;93;2022-06-12;208;Aline’s place is fabulous and she is a delightful host. We stayed for 11 nights and felt we’d been away much longer. The island is so beautiful and relaxing. The house is lovely and well equipped. We particularly enjoyed swimming in the river and the pool was good too. And Aline provides such a lot of activity equipment and games - it’s more than we’ve seen at many campsites. The island is right beside a super cycle path and it was a joy cycling along the river in the morning to collect the bread. Overall fantastic!;10
1032;93;2022-06-22;209;Magical island stay in Le Moulin de Malvy. We loved swimming in the river and the pool, cycling to the local town for provisions, kayaking to the pub, and playing tabletennis in the evenings. Wonderful place for a relaxing family holiday.;9
1033;93;2022-08-29;210;Great Island, nice people and a lovely stay.;10
1034;93;2022-09-08;211;En exceptionally nice small house located on an idyllic island - one of my best airbnb stays I have ever experienced!!;10
1035;93;2022-09-11;212;We have had 20 great airbnb stays and Aline’s island is the best one yet. Words cannot do justice to the beauty and tranquility of her island and the surrounding countryside. It was a privilege to stay there.;9
1036;94;2022-07-05;213;"Harold has been the best AirBnb host I’ve had - he was so responsive, proactive and helpful! He accommodated all our needs and made sure we had the most spectacular visit.
The location, house and staff were amazing - planning to go back next year!";10
1037;94;2022-07-30;214;We had a great family time and enjoyed ourselves a lot!!;8
1038;94;2022-08-24;215;Beautiful and peaceful getaway, I encourage everyone to try. You’re out in nature and nobody else... the island is very well equipped as well and there’s services that can help you out at all times too so you don’t have to fear anything.;10
1039;94;2022-09-02;216;excelente lugar recomendable solo.las escaleras ala recamara principal super peligrosas pero.lo demás muy bien;10
1040;95;2022-07-24;217;Una experiencia increíble , el lugar es sencillamente encantador , perfecto para compartir en familia o con amigos , el personal de la isla es muy atento y prestan un servicio excelente. La estadía en esta isla fue realmente algo que vale la pena , diferentes ambientes que permiten apreciar la vista en 360. La cercanía a diferentes lugares turísticos es un plus , Víctor fue de gran ayuda y estuvo pendiente de todos los detalles . Me encantaría volver .;10
1041;96;2021-11-25;218;The small house is perfect for a couple, it was an amazing stay with all the amenities you could possibly want. It was comfortable, quiet and very close walking distance to all the great sights and restaurants around Jeonju. Would highly recommend and definitely one of the best accommodations I have ever stayed at.;10
1042;96;2022-06-07;219;I'm a Jeonju person, but thanks to a friend, I was able to find a place to stay in a hanok village, but it was a private house and the surroundings were💛 quiet, so I had a comfortable stay. If you come to visit, this is a place I would highly recommend.🥰;8
1043;96;2022-06-08;220;I really like this place, clean, kind owner and very close to the village.;10
1044;96;2022-06-11;221;It was so satisfying and it was a cozy space. It's 200% willing to revisit at a later date!! It's neat and there's a lot of preparation, so it's👍 hard to pay attention to it. I'm staying so well:);8
1045;96;2022-06-12;222;my husband and I really enjoyed our stay! the hanok is so lovely and of course private. priced higher than others but totally worth it because it was modern and luxurious. it has modern furnishings on the inside, with a quaint and traditional exterior. Amenities are top notch (auto water dispenser for hot and cold water, nepresso and capsules, a jacuzzi, Dyson fan, hair dryer, purifier, heater and air conditioner and of course Aesop products which I love)! we always looked forward to going back to spend time, as it is warm and pretty. bed was also very comfortable! I will recommend this to anyone going to Jeonju!;10
1046;96;2022-06-22;223;That was the best stay in my life! So beautiful and feels right like home! I’ve never wanted to extend stay so bad! Perfect! Host is so nice! Everything was great! Definitely will come again!;10
1047;96;2022-08-29;224;When I come back to Jeonju, it was so nice that I would definitely want to stay again. I was also very satisfied with the facilities and items provided inside. It feels like all the fatigue that builds up as soon as you enter the house. The place was the most healing than anything else. ;10
1048;96;2022-09-08;225;This place is absolutely amazing. Beautifully decorated, simple and clean. We felt really at home here immediately and slept so well. The house was fresh and clean and the perfect temperature for winter-not too hot but not cold at all!! The outside area has nice sun in the afternoon and the surrounding area is very quiet. It is also very close to all of the fun shops and streets of Jeonju Hanok Village, so you couldn’t ask for a better location. The bathtub is enormous and the water is very warm, and the kitchen is well stocked for simple cooking. The host added nice thoughtful touches like a Dyson hair dryer with the air wrap too, a nice water purifier and lots of clean towels. I would stay here again any time, it was one of our best Airbnb experiences! ;9
1049;96;2022-09-11;226;I've been half-hearted, but I'm so grateful for the space. Today, I used it comfortably like my own home. The bathroom was clean, the house was really cozy, and the boiler was really nice. It was a meaningful time to watch the movie with the beam projector! In the yard, we ate sweet potatoes and enjoyed the real house life! ;10
1050;96;2022-11-30;227;Just like every other review has stated, this place is beautiful, cozy, and peaceful. I especially loved the traditional Hanok with the modern aesthetic interior design. You can tell that the host is very meticulous and puts a lot of care in preparing the house for her guests. The host is thoughtful even with the smallest details, like adding subtle ambience music outside the house. I thought that was such a nice touch since it made everything feel more romantic. The entire house was absolutely spotless and clean. I came during a very cold winter day, but we were greeted with a perfectly warm and cozy home. The location is also very convenient as it’s right in the middle of Jeonju’s Hanok Village. The host is very friendly and responsive! She is also very accommodating and allowed us to check in two hours earlier — which we really appreciated. Overall, my boyfriend and I had a very enjoyable and restful weekend. This is one of the best Airbnb experiences we’ve ever had.;10
1051;97;2021-10-16;228;Tanja is polite and welcoming hostess. She is easily accessible and communicates clearly. Tanja’s house was well located near by the west slopes of Levi, inside the forest in private houses area. Although next to a small road, it is a quiet surrounding. You would find all necessary amenities in kitchen for cooking, large table for family dinner and nice living room, full of light from large windows. Commonly to Finland you can use sauna and even hot tub on outdoor veranda and fireplace in living room creates nice cozy atmosphere. Its great for family holiday.;9
1052;97;2021-10-20;229;"Tanja was a great host, very responsive and extremely helpful in the run up to our stay. Whilst we were there she checked in with us to make sure everything was to our satisfaction.

Towards the end of the stay my rental car was hit nearby and although it was nothing to do with her she was extremely helpful in helping me translate the message from the other party and even offered to contact them herself if they didn't speak English.

One of the best hosts I've ever had the pleasure to rent from.";10
1053;97;2021-11-11;230;"The house was great!

Amazing location close to the ski lifts (200m walk to West Point lifts).

Beautiful house with large living area, big kitchen, fireplace, sauna and hot tub (extra cost). They also have a dryer cupboard which is very useful during winter!

Tanja is lovely host and communication was super easy!

Highly recommend!";8
1054;97;2021-11-14;231;We really had an amazing time! Tanja was very helpful and also left a welcome gift when we arrived, which was a nice surprise. The house has everything that you need , well equipped and very close to the ski slopes. There are lots of supermarkets and restaurants in Levi. The elves park is definitely worth a visit if you have children. We also booked a husky’s and reindeer trip from Levi. We decided already to come back and couldn’t think of a better place then Tanja’s place. Thanks Tanja for the good care!;8
1055;97;2021-11-25;232;We had the most amazing stay here! Absolutely gorgeous Chalet, feels very remote but only a very short drive to Levi so the best of both worlds. Tanja was extremely helpful and friendly. Thank you for making our holiday so special!;10
1056;97;2022-06-07;233;"We had a wonderful time at Tania’s place. The chalet is new, well cared, and squeaky clean. The kitchen is well equipped, and we really appreciated that there were some toys for our son to play with.

Tanja was very welcoming, gave us plenty of recommendations, and was flexible with our checkout. We were very happy";10
1057;97;2022-06-08;234;"Tanja's ""Bright and modern chalet near skiing & amenities"" was really nice and comfortable accommodation for our ""extended family"" (6 adults and one baby child).
Information in AirBnB about the place was accurate, the house was very clean and functional (extra points to kitchen equipment and sauna), and Tanja responded always quickly to our requests. The location of the house is great, especially for those who enjoy easy access to the slopes.
We will be back !!!";10
1058;97;2022-06-11;235;Tania’s house is beautiful and everything we were looking for. Those massive floor to ceiling windows made us feel right in the wilderness but close proximity to everything. House was very clean, Tanja was fantastic and can’t wait to return.;9
1059;97;2022-06-12;236;"The chalet is beautiful and clean. The host is polite and answers quickly which is great. There is a guest manual that leaves no questions for the stay. Wi-Fi worked fine. The sauna was amazing and it is indeed a ski in - ski out placement. The tv was able to connect to a phone which made it possible to watch what we wanted.

We were two couples staying in the chalet and it fit perfectly for our needs.";10
1060;97;2022-06-22;237;"Tanja and Max chalet was very nice and confortable. It is well located and well equipped. We recommend if you want to spend a nice time in Levi. Tanja was available very easily and her answers were quick and accurate.
We were happy to find champagne and chocolate for our arrival :) we will come back with pleasure !";10
1061;97;2022-08-29;238;"Beautiful chalet, in a superb location. Extremely central to everything. Warm and comfortable with a beautiful sauna.
Tanja is extremely helpful and goes above and beyond to source information if she doesn’t know the answer straight away. A pleasure to deal with.
If we ever go back to Levi this is where we would stay without a hesitation .";9
1062;97;2022-09-08;239;"We had a lovely time in Kittilä & Levi. Beautiful surroundings with all the lap country activities you can think of.
The cottage was nice to stay, well equipped with all the comforts and Tanja was helpful and friendly.
An ideal place to stay with children or only with friends.";10
1063;98;2022-04-07;240;Peaceful, beautiful, and such a dope space;8
1064;98;2022-05-08;241;This was such a magical place. ✨️ Everything felt so thought out. It was such a lovely escape from the city. Highly recommend!;10
1065;98;2022-06-01;242;Wowww this place was so beautiful! Straight out of a magazine, Forest and Andy did an amazing job. Very peaceful with the river flowing by, quiet, the sunlight shining in the windows is a sight to behold. Thanks for having us! Super quick easy trip from Seattle, makes a great getaway:);10
1066;98;2022-06-12;243;The cabin was beautiful and the stay was a wonderful experience. everything was exactly as described in the listing. Forest and Andy provided quick responses to my questions.;10
1067;98;2022-06-22;244;What a beautiful cabin! Super cozy with an amazing view. It was bittersweet to leave and we can't wait to come back and stay longer. We brought in our groceries but the local grocery store wasn't too far away when we needed a few items. I highly recommend this place.;9
1068;98;2022-08-29;245;Forest and Andy's place was absolutely lovely. Great furnishings, awesome hot tub, spacious shower - an all around fantastic stay. The hosts obviously have a great eye for design and the little touches like record player and live-edge furniture topped off the experience. We would definitely recommend.;10
1069;98;2022-09-08;246;This cabin was a magical retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city. The images truly captured the essence of the space - the skylights in the cabin make you feel like you're in a treehouse, even on a rainy PNW weekend. The cozy Pendleton-provided blankets, warm fire, and jazzy bluesy vinyl collection made for the perfect ambiance. The live plants added a touch of elegance and made the space even more special. The sound of the rushing river and the hot tub were the perfect way to start and end the day. I cannot recommend this cabin enough - it was a truly peaceful and grounding experience. MAGIC.;9
1070;99;2019-09-02;247;"The other reviews already say it all but I’ll echo them anyway.
First, Fred was awesome to work with. He answered questions quickly leading up to our stay. He proactively gave advice about our trip including advice for things to do outside of our stay with him. This place is beautiful (more on that next) but Fred takes all of the effort out of planning and makes your stay great.

Second, Elaine was an amazing cook for us. She was awesome to be around and gave lots of advice for areas to snorkel and more. We give our highest recommendation to hire her! You won’t have to worry about any meals!

Lastly, the island… wow. What more can really be said about this paradise. Every part of it was beautiful. Our group enjoyed laying in the hammocks, snorkeling, fishing, reading, kayaking, and libations! We had faster internet than expected so we were able to FaceTime kids back home.";10
1071;99;2020-03-01;248;Bird Island was a wonderful experience. Highlights were the swings for the kids, stargazing each night, fishing with Thurman, snorkeling and just bumming around the beautiful island. Thank you!;10
1072;99;2021-02-24;249;"Absolutely stunning experience. True sense of privacy in a beautiful, one of a kind island. Fred and his team made everything easy. Highly recommend fishing with Thurman - you'll likely have enough fresh mackerel, yellowtail, tuna, etc for your stay with one half-day of fishing. Plus Thurman's wife made an amazing spread of stewed chicken, fried plantains, coconut rice and beans, coleslaw, pickled chilis, onions & vinegar sauce, and a bread pudding dessert for the fishing trip (a lunch worth seeking out by itself, seriously). If you're a cook, the kitchen, bar and grills (charcoal & gas) on the island are well equipped to make the most of your catch & provisions (+ citrus juicers, cocktail shakers, good barware). The island itself is an ongoing labor of love; you feel it in a million unique touches. Plenty of fun water equipment to entertain yourself and the snorkeling is great. No annoying bugs. Just hermit crabs and pelicans and you on the island. GO!";9
1073;99;2021-02-28;250;Bird Island defied all of our expectations! We celebrated our twins’ birthday there, and Ms.Ruth surprised us with decorations, candles, and two absolutely gorgeous cakes waiting in the dining area upon our arrival. Miss Elaine is the BEST cook, and she introduced us to and spoiled us with her delicious Belizean dishes during our stay. We woke up to beautiful sunrises and fell asleep to the sound of the wind and waves. There was no shortage of fun activities to do every day and we didn’t want to leave! We had a great day of fishing with Thurman who was very kind, knowledgeable, and patient. We can’t wait to get back to our new home away from home. If you are looking for paradise then book a stay at Bird Island!;10
1074;99;2021-06-07;251;An amazing vacation, once-in-lifetime experience. Best snorkeling I've ever seen. Can't say enough about Fred and Ruth. They went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we could ever want, even bringing us amenities we needed from town. Must do fishing trip with Thurman. Wish we would've stayed longer!;8
1075;99;2021-07-31;252;"You know it's a great vacation when you're walking around enjoying your private island and talking about how all of the 5 star reviews make sense. It's beautiful, it's private, and it's amazing. We adored Elaine, our incredible chef who introduced us to Belize's fabulous cuisine. We snorkeled, paddle boarded, kayaked, ate, drank and were very merry. We had lovely sunsets spent on the hammocks. It was the vacation of a lifetime.

We also had Seahorse Dive Shop pick us up for an excursion of diving, lunch and snorkeling at Laughing Bird Caye.";10
1076;99;2022-08-31;253;"WOW. My friend group of 6 stayed at Bird Island for 4 days and we had an amazing, relaxing time. It truly is an oasis in the ocean. A few recommendations based on our experience:
1. Hire the cook (Elaine)! She was wonderful, cooked us 3 FULL meals plus snacks every day and gave us lots of tips for the reef and Belize travel in general.
2. If you hire Elaine, she will shop for all the food for the main dishes, you will shop for your own snacks/alcohol/etc. Her meals are so filling that you will not need as much food as you think!
3. Have Fred book you the local flight from BZE International to Placencia Airport. It is a huge time saver and a cool experience to take a prop plane over the Belize coast to Placencia.
4. “Walter” was our taxi driver from the Placencia airport to/from Fred’s shop. He asked for $30USD per way for our group of 6, but after he left a local at the airport told us it is only $15USD per way for any size group.";10
1077;100;2022-07-19;254;We had an incredible stay! Jo was really helpful, giving us a map and telling us about the best sites to see and places to eat, the villa is centrally located so everything was only a short drive away. Communication was easy and Jo was always very quick to respond to any questions we had. The villa itself, and the shared pool area, were immaculately kept and beautiful. The views from the balcony and pool were stunning, we loved watching the sunset. We were also grateful for the thoughtful touches, a few supplies (bread, spreads, biscuits and water) were very helpful when we arrived. Thank you Faye and Jo!;10
1078;100;2022-08-08;255;Absolutely glorious stay. The view was breathtaking (I mean you can’t get better then a pool and ocean view) & we loved coming to a fridge with treats and toast for breakfast and a snack. A cleaner came everyday when we were gone and it was so nice to come back to a very tidy space. The decorations were absolutely dreamy & they put all the small detailed touches to feel comfortable while we were there. We are so grateful. The hosts are absolutely wonderful. Do yourself a favor and stay here for a restful experience.;9
1079;100;2022-08-26;256;"Jo takes pride in hosting, from giving recommendations for restaurants, sights, and how to get around, to responding to all messages promptly. She and her team thought of everything for their guests and even helped book our transfer from the airport. A car is helpful if you stay here -and for getting around Milos in general. Already planning my return to hopefully stay with her again. Thank you Jo!!
John";10
1080;100;2022-09-03;257;We absolutely loved our stay! The property is spacious and welcoming and our room was perfect and super clean. We especially loved the pool and the view! We will definitely look forward to staying here again.;9
1081;101;2022-09-21;258;For us this is a 5/5 experience for sure! We stayed here six nights.;10
1082;102;2022-07-19;259;What a unique and comfortable home. We are a family of 6 and we stayed at the mill for a month. Rozenn was always very friendly and responsive to anything we needed. We arrived to delicious local wine and jam! She accommodated us on our late arrival and welcomed us to a warm, clean home. She has lots of booklets and information on things to do in the area. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook our meals and the pantry was stocked with a few basics. We’ve stayed in many airbnbs but never in a home like this one. I think we will always talk about our stay at windmill. I would recommend staying there in the summer if you can.;10
1083;102;2022-08-08;260;The most fantastic windmill and stay! We had a great time in the countryside and enjoyed our walks and trips to neighbouring villages. You definitely need a car to stay here - but if you do, you’ll have everything you need within 15 mins drive. The windmill is warm, cosy, clean, and well looked after and the neighbours are very nice. You probably don’t want to squeeze much more than 3 people in as it is small still on communal space. Wifi is great and works well, but needs to be moved around a little to get to all rooms. Mobile data coverage is also great. Overall an excellent place to stay, highly recommended.;8
1084;102;2022-08-26;261;"Beautifully restored wind mill in a calm and peaceful setting. Our kids also loved the rooms and the view as well as the games and the spacious garden to play in.
Rozenn was easy to communicate with and she made sure everything was in place and ready for our stay. Many thanks and we highly recommend Rozenn’s place for a lovely holiday.";10
1085;102;2022-09-03;262;We had a great weekend in the Moulin de Rozenn. The accommodation is atypical, it has some character. It is well appointed and equipped. The recent renovation is very successful. The living room with its large table was perfect for our family reunion. The bedrooms are cozy and the view of the area, from the top floor bedroom in particular, is very beautiful.;10
1086;103;2022-08-08;263;A very nice stay!;10
1087;104;2022-08-08;264;This is truly a jewel. Highly recommended!;9
1088;104;2022-08-26;265;Unique place and house with lots of charm.;10
1089;105;2022-07-19;266;Beautiful and just as pictured.;10
1090;105;2022-08-08;267;Cabin was awesome, Jonathan was great! Would definitely recommend this cabin.;9
1091;105;2022-08-26;268;First time to a cabin and it was everything I hoped for. Thank you Johnathan!!!;10
1092;105;2022-09-03;269;Great stay and beautiful cabin!;8
1093;106;2021-10-16;270;Absolutely gorgeous property, our wine group had a great time;10
1094;106;2021-10-20;271;We had a wonderful mini family reunion at the house. There were plenty of bedrooms and bathrooms for all of us! The house was so well stocked with games, kids’ toys, linens, towels, and all the kitchen supplies needed to cook and eat our meals there. We enjoyed fishing with Don and hanging out in the hot tub. The location was very convenient to many local vineyards and Petaluma. Lastly, the Pinot Noir from the Flying Cloud vineyard was excellent!!;10
1095;106;2021-11-11;272;We were thrilled with this Airbnb. The host was so thoughtful, helpful, responsive, and took the time to check us in personally to ensure we knew where things were, how they worked, etc. They offered recommendations for activities, vendors for catering, etc, and nearby wineries to visit. We loved our time here and couldn’t have been happier.;9
1096;106;2021-11-14;273;Great place, and so easy to settle in and enjoy with all the host’s support;10
1097;106;2021-11-25;274;The pictures on the site don’t do the house justice. It is absolutely stunning. Chris was fantastic with check-in. The house was very clean and well taken care of. We stayed for a family trip, and it was easy to get from the house to downtown Santa Rosa via Uber/Lyft.;9
1098;107;2022-07-19;275;We had a wonderful day here! Cute little place with all you need! Very clean and well equipped. Feeling like home. There are ingredients you need for a wonderful breakfast, very thoughtful and sweet! 👍;10
1099;107;2022-08-26;276;My daughter and I had a wonderful night at the hobbit house and will always remember it. It's truly a special place, built and cared for with love, and the craftsmanship is incredible. Daffodils were blooming all around when we were there. The house was also immaculately clean and very comfortable. Highly recommend for those looking for a cozy and unique getaway.;10
1100;107;2022-09-03;277;We enjoyed our stay at Marlan's Hobbit Style Underground Cabin. The place was cozy and met the description. Marlan met us upon arrival and answered any questions we had. The property was stocked with coffee, tea, popcorn, waffle ingredients, juice, and more. Marlan also provided the supplies to build a fire. The property looked as expected, was easy to access, and private. We would definitely recommend staying here one day.;9
1101;108;2022-06-22;278;Great place to stay, very recommended.;9
1102;108;2022-07-03;279;Veery beautiful!! :);10
1103;108;2022-07-19;280;The accommodations and surrounding area are spectacular. The town is quiet and serene and is surrounded by forest. We had a wonderful time walking around the village and the ancient ruins. We caught a boat to Bratislava for a day trip. All in all, we had a wonderful holiday.;9
1104;108;2022-08-08;281;Amazing place. Totally recommend;10
1105;108;2022-08-26;282;The ecovillage is simply amazing. the perfect place to relax and free your mind while connecting with the peace and nature that surround you all around the village. an unforgettable experience!;10
1106;108;2022-09-03;283;Absolutely amazing if you’ve come across this place I would recommend staying and definitely have a bath in this amazing built treehouse which if your wondering yes is very big and private this place was a stop for me and my girlfriend and we wish we both could have stayed longer connect with nature and relax it was also our first experience with the “tiny house” movement which is amazing and something I’ve always wanted to try!;9
1107;109;2022-06-22;284;"the tree house is fabulous !
it is like to live a dream in the forest. If the wind comes of course staying inside is a bit wild but awesome at the same time. Keep in mind to walk 3 minutes on the wood from the parking to reach the treehouse !!";10
1108;109;2022-07-03;285;We stayed in this beautiful treehouse on an exceptional location with our 5 and 8 year-old girls for one night. It's a nice construction and feels very safe and sturdy. The kids were disappointed that we didn't stay longer. Everything was clean and well taken care of. Just be prepared for limited water and electricity provision. Make sure to visit the cosy restaurant in the village (10-minute walk) and to climb up to the refuge (45-minute walk).;8
1109;109;2022-07-19;286;Experience in the middle of the unforgettable forest!;10
1110;109;2022-08-08;287;We had a lovely time in the cabin, it is located in a secluded place surrounded by nature which is very nice. The link with Celine was very easy, she gave us all the information we needed.;10
1111;109;2022-08-26;288;"Beautiful treehouse perched in the middle of trees, alone and therefore very quiet, functional with windows everywhere. Perfect heating, very clean dry toilet and kitchen with minimum required. Very responsive and welcoming host.
We highly recommend!";10
1112;110;2022-07-19;289;La casa sull'albero si trova in una posizione eccezionale e offre una splendida vista sulle colline circostanti. Siamo stati accolti con tanta passione dagli host e serviti per la colazione.;9

Nos hôtes ont été très accueillants, réactifs et disponibles.
Nous recommandons fortement :)";10
1114;111;2022-06-22;291;Just wow. We had the most magnifique experience at Nicolas’ treehouse - it is the most charming Airbnb I’ve been to and so creatively put together. It had everything we needed despite being quite a little space. We’re not that tall so we had plenty of headroom. The bed was incredibly comfortable too! Surrounded by greenery, we could watch the sunset against a beautiful mountain view, gaze at the stars and fully relax in nature. We also had views of the cows and an adorable goat. While we didn’t use the grill we imagine it to be a great plan. The charming Chateau de la Roche is only about a 15 minutes drive away.;9
1115;111;2022-07-03;292;Nicolas and his parents were amazing and incredibly helpful -going above and beyond at every opportunity. They gave us a hearty breakfast every day, let us borrow their bikes, and even gave us a lift to the station on our last day! We could not have hoped for a better holiday. The Treehouse was amazing and we made friends with the goat.;10
1116;111;2022-07-19;293;Super cute tree house and even cuter hosts. Communication was great, the tree house has warm & cold water and there’s a fridge next to it. So everything was provided to have great time in a tree in the french outskirts. 😜 thanks to for everything to the hosts.🚡 🧺 🥐;10
1117;111;2022-08-08;294;"Great welcome, lovely and attentive hosts. Breakfast included and delicious.
Perfect place for a night in love, my man and I were absolutely delighted with this experience:)";8
1118;111;2022-08-26;295;The treehouse is wonderfully located and offers a beautiful view of the surrounding hills. We were welcomed with a lot of passion by the hosts and catered for breakfast.;10
1119;112;2021-11-25;296;It was amazing! The only thing that threw us off was that we heard 3-4 loud booming sounds at night, which kind of scared us. But overall, it was a really cool experience.;10
1120;112;2022-07-19;297;"It was wonderful.
My wife loves tree houses.
It was a beautiful experience to be inside the house with the tree and feel like moving with it sometimes.
Very very nice place.
We loved how nice and warm were the bathroom and the house.
We hope we can come back in the summer for outside bath!";10
1121;112;2022-08-26;298;This place is magical! The hosts were so kind and friendly! You can tell a lot of love went into the building of this place! So quiet and cozy :);9
1122;113;2022-06-22;299;"If you want a 5* hotel with fancy room service, dont come here.
If you want one of the most peaceful places on earth, with surroundings that take your breath away, where you feel the nature interact with you, see the hummingbirds outside the door, feel rest, peace, and well being, then come here.

I have traveled to about 80 countries, lived ion 3 continents, stayed in Airbnb's in Europe, South America, Africa, USA, Asia, and Latin America. Very few hosts have been as kind and helpful as Tiberio. No matter what you need, he is always helpful and responsive. One feels loved, accepted and well looked after.
My wife and I needed a place to get away and rest, and recharge. This was perfect.
Thank you Tiberio";10
1123;113;2022-07-03;300;"The host is extremely kind, discreet, attentive… .saest so many good predicates that it is not possible to write here….. Beautiful location and all very tidy. I was there with my little daughter of 1 year and 7 months, she loved spending her days in the tree….
Loved being there and will be back soon.";9
1124;113;2022-07-19;301;The forest refuge is a magical place, very cozy, full of spirituality. A perfect place to reconnect.;10
1125;113;2022-08-08;302;The treehouse is so special. Both the house itself and the entire surroundings have such a wonderful energy that, despite all the incredible tips that Tiberius gave us, we didn't want to take the car to get out of there. We walked to Pico da Raposa (there on the side) to see the sunset (beautiful!) and Tiberius took us for a walk to a very special place. In fact, we have to go back to see the places he recommended. We were able to enjoy the house, the sensational view and the perfect nature around. They were days of great peace and quiet. And it was an honor to meet Tiberius! Just gratitude! _/\_;10
1126;114;2022-05-30;303;The look out tower was a very unique experience. The hike up during a snow storm was very difficult. Pack light as it was quite steep in areas. David the snow cat driver was wonderful. The views were amazing and we enjoyed the thoughtful touches Kristie left for us. Communication was great! Highly recommend for a peaceful getaway.;9
1127;114;2022-06-10;304;We had a wonderful stay! It was magical to have silence in our lives. Something we do not get often at all. Feeling recharged and can not wait to return or try one of Kristie’s other spots. Thanks again!;10
1128;114;2022-06-22;305;We enjoyed staying at the cabin. It is a very unique experience and very beautiful place!;8
1129;114;2022-08-29;306;Che posto fantastico per festeggiare il 30 ° compleanno di mio marito. Il belvedere era così accogliente con il caminetto, e guardare fuori le finestre a 360 gradi su una fresca coltre di neve era magico. Il tempo sembrava lento perché siamo riusciti a vivere nel momento e goderci la reciproca compagnia in uno spazio bellissimo. La sauna era incredibile per rilassarsi dopo un po' di divertimento in slitta al freddo. Ultimo ma non meno importante: David, l'autista di gatti, è un gioiello!;10
1130;115;2022-05-30;307;"Luogo semplicemente incantato, si vive praticamente tra le fronde degli alberi, in una foresta con alberi secolari.
Ospitalità molto discreta e cordiale";8

1136;116;2022-07-19;313;"Nous avons passées un merveilleux WE. C’est une expérience totalement insolite et dépaysante.
Nous nous sommes senties en sécurité même au milieu de la forêt.
Jean-Marie notre hôte, ainsi que tout le personnel étaient plus qu'acceuillants et aux petits soins.
Les toilettes et la douche sont certes communes mais elles étaient très propres.
Il y a un restaurant sur place pour diner, le repas était délicieux mais un peu cher à notre goût, il faut prévoir un budget de 30€/personne.
Seul bémol, nous avons eu froid pendant la nuit, je vous conseille de prendre des vêtements très chauds.
Globalement cette expérience était très positive, je vous la recommande vivement.";10
1137;116;2022-08-08;314;A unforgettable experience made all the better with the assistance of Jean-Marie! As I traveled here by pedal bike I arrived late but no worry this was catered for no problems! Most beautiful place to relax and escape the modern world nonsense and be at peace, breakfast and dinner delivered via pulley and was more delicious that imagined, if only I could of stayed here forever! I felt leaving I could return and be greeted with a friendly smile no matter when, very down to earth and best of all just honest! This was a solo adventure for my 25th birthday sober and was truly magical;8
1138;117;2022-07-19;315;Le concept est très bien mais malheureusement on a du mal à l’apprécier si le temps n’est pas approprié car le transfert entre la chambre et la cabane de vie se fait par l’extérieur. Obligé de rester confiné dans celle ci si on ne peut pas être dehors et elle est un peu petite. Je trouve le prix un peu élevé ou alors devrait être revu à la baisse en automne.;10

Make sure to use the restaurant reservation offer - it’s the best in the area, we checked others :)

There are a few minor things to improve but our experience was still great.";10
1143;118;2022-09-13;320;"The treehouse is absolutely magical and is a very very memorable place to stay. Wholly enchanting.

Based in the grounds of a historic old moulin (Watermill) the treehouse is very private and absolutely unique place to stay. The balcony looks over quiet fields and it is absolutely beautiful inside with some lovely touches (my favourite being the fire extinguisher disguised as a wine bottle!).

In the grounds there is a wonderful quiet swimming pool that was lovely to cool off in.

The tree house is about 6-7mins drive from some lovely restaurants (eg Branne) and about 15mins to St Emilion and is on a quiet back road so it is silent and there is no light pollution.";10
1144;119;2022-07-03;321;"I had such a wonderful stay here! The owner is so helpful and friendly. It is impossible not to smile when you see or talk to him.

We also had lunch and dinner there good prices, and many options for Us. and He Gives 5-star service! - a visit to Dambulla cave temple, a drive to the fruit market, excellent breakfasts, tasty coffee, and a good laugh. Thank you! Whenever I come to Sigiriya again, this will be the place to stay.

One evening we paid for a lovely 9 dish evening meal . It was worth the money.
The WiFi was not reliable and it should be noted that there is no hot water.
The view from the balcony was of palm trees and very pleasant .";10
1146;119;2022-08-08;323;We really enjoyed a wonderful stay here with a fabulous dinner but be prepared for basic facilities! We decided to stay one night instead of two as there wasn’t as much to do in the area as we had expected.;8

They are very nice people, very communicative, respectful and took care of and left the property in perfect condition.

1150;120;2022-08-29;327;Emma was a really nice guest. They were all clean and tidy, so I recommend them all. There was great communication and everything else. I would love to welcome you back. Good luck Emna;8
1151;121;2022-06-22;328;For the value this is a great spot if your focus is to spend as much time on the ski hills as possible. There is some work to do to the place, but if you aren’t overly picky and love the charm of older style cabins this is the place for you. It also came with a Loveland ski pass so talk about savings!! Overall it was a great stay.;9
1152;122;2022-09-13;329;Travelled with the bike to Sissu, everything was fine. Only thing is, that at this time in the year, it still can be really cold and also inside the building its quite chilly. But apart from that, everything was brilliant, thank you for the nice stay :);8
1153;123;2022-07-09;330;The house was perfect for our group of 12 visiting for our annual ski trip. The kitchen is fully stocked, the beds were extremely comfortable and plenty of games for nightly entertainment. The house has 4 floors with the hot tub, pool table and games on the 2nd floor. We strategically placed our night owls on this floor so the early birds could get sleep without interruption. The house is in a great location, in close proximity to shops, restaurants, as well as Keystone and Breckinridge ski resorts. 4 wheel drive vehicles are necessary as the driveway is a bit steep and slightly difficult to maneuver during winter months. We made a rookie mistake in having one car without 4 wheel drive and it was useless on this trip. Overall, the house is great and the property management group was very responsive and helpful.;9
1154;124;2022-06-22;331;The home was very spacious with beautiful views. Location was perfect, very close to Main Street but central enough to check out other small towns. We loved our stay and would definitely stay there again!;9

1157;126;2022-07-19;334;"Comfortable place to come back to after spending all day snowboarding at breck for the week. Booked this place solely because of the hot tub and views which did not disappoint. Couple things to be aware of
1) Dog hair everywhere. Woke up with dog hair in my mouth so if you have pet allergies this could be an issue for you.
2) Instructions for fireplace state to use kindling and lighter fluid to start the fire however those items are not provided.
3) The other reviews stating the necessity for a 4x4 vehicle to access this property is an understatement. I got stuck in a 4x4 and shoveled my way out. Another guest got stuck in the driveway and ended up calling a tow truck.
The host was kind enough to check in with me after we settled in which was nice. He was responsive as well.";10
1158;126;2022-08-08;335;The location is amazing, your surrounded by beautiful picturesque mountains. We saw a bunny playing in the snow and a moose grazing on some grass all from the kitchen window. The cabin was also very clean, not a speck of dust in site. There is a small town about 6 miles away that has a little bar where you can also grab a bite to eat. It’s a short drive to Breckenridge so it’s perfect for anyone wanting to hit the slopes. Check in and Check out we’re also a breeze. We will definitely book again!;9

We did have some issues connecting with the internet when we first arrived, but their house manager was responsive immediately and eager to get the situation remedied. As Los Angelenos, we appreciated the heads up about adjusting to the altitude and were able to take the proper precautionary measures. Blue River is the perfect distance from downtown Breckenridge and we appreciated both the water pressure of the showers and the hot tub after a fun day of snowboarding. Very positive experience and we especially loved all of the fun board and card games the house had.;10

The mountain setting was absolutely gorgeous with views from every window! There was a wood burning stove that we used frequently that made the house very warm. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a peaceful getaway in a cabin with a rustic setting!;10
1172;130;2022-05-28;349;"The House was Amazing. Just as described. Had all the conveniences you could ever want - even plenty of games and puzzles. All the bedrooms were Master Size which was really nice. Great Kitchen to cook in. And of course Great Views. The game room downstairs with both Pool Table as well as Card Table was a hit as well. The jacuzzi was clean and well maintained.

Only slight (and it is very slight) drawback was the the kitchen sink did not drain very well and the dishwasher didn't clean very well. It wasn't a big deal - we were just careful with what we put in the drain. Again - not a big deal, and we let them know so I'm sure it is fixed. Aside from that small inconvenience, this is an outstanding property in a Great Location -- all the modern conveniences and comforts, but still has the ""frontier feel.""";9

The kitchen was well appointed and had plenty of dishes and cutlery, pots and pans, etc. The bedrooms were very large and comfortable. The main laundry room was convenient and had a nice washer and dryer. The garage refrigerator was nice to have for extras. We enjoyed the hot tub and very nice outdoor grill. The dishwasher was not working properly and we had a maintenance guy come out twice but the issue was not resolved during our stay. However, Local responded immediately and the maintenance guy came out timely. He was very professional.
I do have one warning: this house sits at over 10,000 feet so if you are altitude sensitive be careful. Overall, our stay was great and we loved the house!";8

1179;131;2022-05-29;356;Needed a place for 2 families, last minute, after another air bnb didn’t work out. The family time folks came through for us, I truly appreciated it. The place is nice and cozy. The area got a lot of snow but the local support was able to keep the parking and access paths clear. It’s a really good spot to venture out to the parks from - one hour to Zion, same to Bryce canyon the other direction. 30 minutes to Cedar city if you want more restaurant or shopping options.;10
1180;131;2022-07-26;357;We enjoyed our stay. It was all as described. Unfortunately, an issue with the upstairs bathroom which we mentioned early-on wasn’t addressed. The kitchen could have a bit more utensils, pots… But we enjoyed our stay.;8

1183;131;2023-04-02;360;We booked our first cabin way down the the mountain and the night before our stay we got a message informing us that the main water line was broke so they could not accommodate our stay but we were already close by so they offered us another listing and we took it. We traveled only 8 miles up the mountain to find out that the snow was 159% above average. When we got to the cabin the driveway had about 14 inches of snow and so we asked for assistance and they informed us that they don’t plow unless it’s 16” deep so we thought we could shovel some and drive our 4WD vehicles in and the snow was too frozen. We went to the door thinking we could go in and get warm while figuring out how to get our vehicles in and the code would not work Family Time worked hard to help us. It was just too cold to stand out their any longer and it was getting late in the evening and too cold. So we just left and when they got back on we just asked for a refund and they gave it to us also Airbnb Thank you!;10
1184;132;2022-08-08;361;Beautiful home with four bedrooms and well-equipped kitchen, a short walk to both Amalfi and Atrani, perfect for a family visit. We particularly enjoy spending time on the two terraces to marvel at the view of Amalfi and the sea. Bruno the host has been responsive to various requests, including arranging a chef to prepare dinner and making reservations at restaurants.;9
1185;132;2022-08-26;362;Bruno and his team are the absolute best! Casa Massa is stunning and exactly as the pictures show. The views are breathtaking and the property is incredible. This is the best bnb experience our group has collectively had! Do not think twice about booking this property! Heaven!!!;10
1186;132;2022-09-03;363;"I was having my wedding at Amalfi and needed a large enough home for my family to stay. Bruno’s airbnb was perfect, with 4 en-suite bedrooms, a big dining table, large living room, gorgeous terrace and a pool. The view from the home was priceless.
The home had so many beautiful custom design touches, that showed the thoughtfulness of how the home was built.
As a host, Bruno was super responsive and helpful with any questions/requests that we had. He helped set up a private chef to come and cook us a few dinners, which was a perfect way to end your day. The location is fairly central to the main part of Amalfi town.
There is someone that cleans every day (but sundays) and a groundskeeper that also was very helpful (bringing us groceries, carrying up our bags, etc.)
Note, I do not think this is a place for smaller children as there are many nicer elements to the home that isn’t really childproofed.
Similar to other places in Amalfi, you will need to climb up some stairs to get to the home.";9
1187;133;2022-08-20;364;This place was magical! The most beautiful views and the friendliest staff! Bruno, Giovanna, chef Angelo, Katiya and Maddelena were just amazing. Always with a smile and ready to help In any way! The only draw backs were the distance to get anywhere else ( Ravello, Positano, etc). and very spotty internet service. Would highly recommend it here!;9
1188;133;2022-09-13;365;Don’t think twice about renting this place just do it! The staff is fabulous…the BEST! Bruno, house manager was always there and so helpful and the chef and Joanna were beyond talented and kind! Mateo was SO great and always made sure we had what we needed. The house was spotless and the views unparalleled. The amenities were great and we had the best family vacation there!!! We will definitely go back!!!;10
1189;134;2022-05-30;366;Just as shown.;10
1190;134;2022-06-10;367;Génial ! Je recommande;9
1191;134;2022-06-22;368;Great place to stay, very recommended.;9
1192;134;2022-08-29;369;Veery beautiful!! :);9
1193;135;2022-07-30;370;We had a wonderful stay and the hosts were absolutely lovely, so warm and welcoming and even baked us a cake on our last day!;10
1194;135;2023-01-05;371;We spent New Year's Eve with friends at this villa complete with all the comforts. We loved the indoor and outdoor spaces, really nothing to say. Too bad for the check in management only, the exact address should be sent in advance as there is no field in the areas surrounding the house and it was not possible to contact the host to have it.;9
1195;136;2022-08-08;372;The place was beautiful and unforgettable with great local restaurants nearby.;10
1196;136;2022-08-26;373;We had the most magical 2nd leg of our honeymoon here. ;9
1197;136;2022-09-03;374;This was an absolutely amazing experience for my fiancée and I. There was a complimentary bottle of wine and the property was magnificent. Just like the pictures. He was always so friendly to recommend restaurants and places to visit around the area, and guide us around using transportation as needed. We cannot wait to stay here again & refer all of our friends and family to it!;10
1198;137;2022-08-08;375;The steps were all worth it. The place super clean and quaint. Nothing beats a host that is hands on. Thank you, Luca for making us fell right at home. We loved our listing. It was the perfect place for us in Positano. Definitely recommend!;9
1199;137;2022-08-26;376;An amazing location and absolutely gorgeous view. The space was charming and had everything we needed. The stairs were part of the charm. Lorenzo was a great host. Thank you and hope to be back.;10
1200;138;2022-07-19;377;We really enjoyed our stay, the house was beautiful and Mogens was a very friendly and gracious host. We cannot wait to comeback again in the future.;9
1201;139;2022-08-08;378;Stunning space with amazing view! Book for the view and incredibly kind hosts. There’s a shared balcony and shared entryway. Your bathroom is part of the shared entry way, but it is private. We felt very accommodated and would stay again in a heartbeat.;10
1202;139;2022-08-26;379;Wow, what a view! The balcony overlooks Positano and the sea and is the perfect place for a late afternoon aperitif. It was the ideal place for the final leg of our trip through Southern Italy.;10
1203;139;2022-09-03;380;We loved our stay at Casa Victoria. Easy check-in and very well kept home, with a great terrace. Luca set us up with a sunset cruise that we would highly recommend as well!!;9
1204;140;2022-08-08;381;Amazing location and amazing views. The fact that you can walk into town in less than 15 minutes is amazing. Rino was very welcoming and I would definitely stay here again if returning to Amalfi.;10
1205;140;2022-08-26;382;This is a lovely little villa about 4 walk from the harbor and town Square. I enjoyed my stay very much. The space and view are wonderful.;10
1206;140;2022-09-03;383;Good value for a place so close to Amalfi (stunning view). The apartment is spacious and clean and everything works. It is directly on the road (in case this is a concern) but it’s a small price to pay.;9
1207;141;2022-05-29;384;Amazing place in the mountains. Very friendly hosts. Breakfast baskets contained many items. Excellent cappuccino. Beautiful place up in the mountains. However, with large luggage or small kids would try to find easier place close to Positano. Nocelle village offers nature and views you cannot find elsewhere. The view from the balcony was worth the stairs and ride on a bus. Recommend to active people with little luggage.;9
1208;141;2022-07-26;385;"If you aren’t physically capable of walking long distances and hundreds of stairs- no joke - this may not be the best property for you.

We traveled from Rome to get here and it was a full day of travel to due to the multiple trains and buses we had to take. The three buses were unexpected travel expenses we weren’t aware we needed to factor into the trip. We learned that info once the check in information was shared with us the week of the trip. Just a heads up - have plenty of cash with you!";10
1209;141;2022-10-30;386;We loved our stay at Villa Quercia. The room was great with amazing views. The breakfast was good and served on a beautiful terrace looking at the ocean. Just be prepared to do a lot of walking up and down to catch the bus to Positano.;10
1210;142;2022-06-22;387;Everything about this property was easy... communication with the host, parking our car, checking in to the apartment. The apartment itself is perfect and gorgeous! The hosts left a generous tray of snacks, coffee, tea... and even pasta and sauce that we ended up cooking in the kitchen which had everything, including a beautiful view! The views from both decks were incredible. Access to town was so easy but also very easy to travel around the coast, especially given the car park was just a stones throw from the apartment. ;9
1211;142;2022-07-30;388;We absolutely loved the space. Beautiful views;10
1212;142;2022-08-29;389;"Pretty place, clean and really great location! Multiple balconies, and an incredible rainforest shower. Very quiet, and the host is communicative and helpful with setting up transportation. It is very remote though and difficult to get to, I traveled with my sister, but I think for a solo female traveler I would say you probably want something a bit more populated just from a safety perspective.

The other thing is that the bed is super hard, like tbh it is rock hard, but that could totally just be a preference thing. I know Italian beds in general are a bit harder but this was the hardest bed I’ve stayed in during this trip so far (have visited florence, rome, Cefalu, palermo, vallelunga, and scopello).";7
1213;143;2022-08-04;390;"The apartment is absolutely lovely and the view from the balcony is gorgeous.

beware that there are a lot of stairs to climb up and down to get to and from the apartment to the bus stop but apart from that it's absolutely worth it.

they also gave wine, milk and snacks to make us feel at home.";8
1214;143;2022-11-27;391;We stayed in Ravello in winter and it was the quiet haven we were after. The apartment was gorgeous with beautiful views- I would highly recommend.;9
1215;143;2023-04-10;392;Beautiful apartment, clean, spacious, and incredible views. The space was so open, with dual balconies through kitchen and bedroom. Shower was very nice too! We only walked up from Minori to the apartment twice during our stay (we rented electric bikes one day and kept them overnight from Black Lemon - highly recommend). The walk up was pretty tiring, but can be done lol, just took a few breathing breaks along the way. Views from balcony and walk up are incredible. ;8
1216;144;2022-06-22;144;This place was so peaceful and looked just like the pictures. The beds were very comfortable. I instantly felt right at home.;10
1217;144;2022-07-30;145;Amazing place! Highly recommendable!;10
1218;144;2022-08-29;146;We had a couple issues that were promptly taken care of, and we enjoyed our time at Saturnia, the hot springs, the resort and the golf course. The house is clean, the owner was accommodating, but overall didn’t meet our expectations.;10
1219;145;2022-06-24;147;Absolute magic. The small friendly staff at the castle made sure everything was perfect. The castle and the grounds were incredible and unique. Will look for an opportunity to come back in the future!!;10
1220;146;2022-05-30;148;My stay at Castello was wonderful from the beginning to the end . It was my birthday trip and Antonio made a beautiful surprise for me leaving Prosecco in our room . Castello is unique , charming and I could not imagine to choose different place for my special day because It was special stay . Thank you Antonio for being a great host and helping us with dinner reservations . I definitely recommend this Castello for many reasons like for cleanliness , hospitality , great location , outstanding service , beauty of castle, and much more;10
1221;146;2022-06-10;149;Our stay at Castello delle Serre exceeded our expectations. The property, as well as Serre di Rapolano and the surrounding area, are truly beautiful and have so much to be explored. However, the most endearing quality of this property is the hospitality. You will get something at this BNB that you simply cannot get at a corporate stay - the staff are genuinely dedicated to making your stay as enjoyable and easy as possible. The time and effort put into the details made every difference in making this a stay we will never forget.;9
1222;147;2022-05-28;150;Staying at the palace was absolutely magical. An experience that was out of this world. The exterior, the interior, the rooms, the ballroom, the spa, the pantry food: it was all beyond my expectations. Would definitely recommend it to anyone, and I dream of staying there again.;10
1223;147;2022-06-27;151;Matt and Jamie were wonderful hosts for our party! The palace proved to be the perfect place for our group. Everyone was super comfortable, the rooms were beautiful and we had ample space to hang out, have dinner, do yoga and dance in! Matt and Jamie were super responsive throughout the stay, as well and welcoming and helpful for any questions we had. Would definitely recommend! We will likely be going back :);9
1224;147;2022-07-09;152;Matt and Jamie hosted a large group of us (19 in total) over an absolutely magical weekend. The suites were gorgeous with plenty of space and beautiful furnishings, the drawing rooms, towers and dining rooms were perfect places to gather and relax. We LOVED the wines in the basement available. When we arrived the place was lit with gorgeous candles everywhere that created this amazing atmosphere. Oh and the sauna and gym room were so great. We honestly just want to move in. It was hard to leave.;10
1225;147;2022-08-20;153;"THANK YOU SO MUCH for everything!
We had such a nice time in this wonderful location.
We will definitely come back.
✨❤️☺️";10
1226;148;2022-08-26;154;"Absolutely exceptional and unique place. The castle is tastefully renovated, the rooms are comfortable and it is ideal for getting away from the world with family or friends in absolute calm. We had a very nice stay with 9 adults, 3 children and a dog.

It is however necessary to mention real communication problems and equipment very below what one would expect from a place like this (broken jacuzzi, almost unusable oven, wifi in a single room of the building, ...) Nothing very serious taken individually but it is more the accumulation of these small things that spoils the experience a little bit and above all gives the impression of paying a premium price for a place where there is still much more to do.";10
1227;148;2022-09-03;155;Pleasant site for a large group stay;9
1228;149;2022-08-04;156;"The chateau is exceptional. This is a stay in a museum we've had. The terrain is large and very pleasant.
It remains an old castle so necessarily with a decoration at the time. But it's one of the charm.
Not much wifi but it was very good.
We'll definitely be back!";9
1229;149;2022-11-27;157;"Great weekend in this charming castle, the advantage of large tables to enjoy the place with conviviality.

Each has its own bedroom and bathroom for a group of 12 adults and 4 children.";10
1230;150;2022-05-29;158;A night in a castle? With a secret passage? YES PLEASE!!! Be sure to check out the beautiful trail to town (just across the highway) and keep an eye out for live music on the weekend at one of the restaurants.;10
1231;150;2022-07-26;159;"We had a pleasant stay in Gilles apartment There was everything what you need for short stay - comfortable bed, fridge, wine glasses and even a little kitchenette. One small thing was missing - hand washing product. Soap does cost much, get it Gilles 😏
Gilles place is very close to small town called Salbris and there the best wine shop ever - called La cave se rebiffe.
Restaurants closing early in Salbris, so if you're didn't make on time there's a pizza place near railway station - open late 😊";10
1232;150;2022-08-04;160;Amazing flat, way better than the pictures! We will definitely come back;9
1233;150;2022-10-30;161;Gilles went above and beyond for us. We had some transportation issues and helped us get a ride to and from our train. It was like a dream staying in a big castle and the grounds were stunning. I highly recommend!!;10
1234;151;2022-02-28;162;This is our second time staying at chateau de jallanges and it’s always a pleasure. The breakfast is particularly wonderful, and this visit the extraordinary roses were in bloom. Stephane was so generous with our children, offering tennis rackets, swimming, and even sweet treats.;10
1235;151;2022-07-29;163;Wonderful place to stay. Definitely rent a car if you plan to explore the area.;9
1236;151;2022-09-13;164;"We really enjoyed our stay! Very calm and peaceful! The chateau is full of history, is a hidden gem!

Stéphane is a great host that was always attent to our needs! If you really want to have a memorable moment this is the place! We fully recommend it!";9
1237;152;2022-05-29;165;Absolutely wonderful experience. Staying in Schloss Arenfels was very peaceful and relaxing. The views of the Rhein were wonderful and the room was very comfortable. Coupled with a bottle of wine from genusskontor, our stay was the perfect weekend getaway.;10
1238;152;2022-07-26;166;"It was such a unique experience to stay the night in a castle! Our stay was everything we were hoping and more. We met the owner as well; he was very kind!";9
1239;152;2022-08-04;167;Benedikt upgraded our room to a bigger one, I love the castle its pretty huge and definitely amazing. Worth the price, would recommend to those who would want experience sleeping at a castle.;10
1240;153;2022-05-29;168;"Where do i start? Daniela is an extremely unprofessional host, unresponsive, disconnected from reality and has no sense of urgency or responsability.

I booked this place 4 weeks before our trip given all the reviews and ratings thinking that this will be a great experience but it was the total opposite.

Daniela was unresponsive for 4 weeks after i asked her many times to provide recommendations for restaurants, beaches, places to visit but she’ll always say i’ll get back to you and she never does. After many complaints to Airbnb, she finally responded saying that someone will contact me tge day of checkin only! This was unheard of for me that a host communicates only the day of checkin.

The checkin process and people were good. They send you videos and instructions that are pretty clear and easy to follow.";10
1241;153;2022-07-26;169;This apartment has one of the best views we have ever experienced. Fun and unique property to stay at with our family of five. Loved how close it was to both towns. Easy walk and great fun at the beach and local restaurants.;9
1242;153;2022-08-04;170;A spectacular spot in a stunning part of the Amalfi coast. The communication and instructions were impeccable and Allessandro was always on hand to respond to questions about the apartment and local advice. The private terrace was beautiful and the apartment spotless and very comfortable with everything you need for a short trip. The castle is halfway between Minori and Maiori so be prepared to walk along the road each way - we did it several times and is totally safe. Would highly recommend;10
1243;154;2022-06-27;171;We had a lovely couple of nights. The village is quiet with an really nice boulangerie. We walked and swam in the lake at St Denis du Maine and had plenty of nice bike rides locally. The apartment is charming. Thanks for a lovely stay.;10
1244;154;2022-07-09;172;"Accommodation perfectly as in description. We are well immersed in a pleasant atmosphere.
Modern and convenient furniture and decorations.";10
1245;154;2022-08-20;173;The apartment is situated in a very charming chateau lost in the French countryside. We loved it! The apartment matched the description and photos of the listing. Large apartment, great shower and in the kitchen there is everything you need to cook a good meal. Located next to a supermarket, ideal for shopping.;9
1246;155;2022-04-12;174;This place is amazing! We had a very large group that fit comfortably. Certainly this was a weekend we will remember for the rest of our lives.;9
1247;155;2022-05-30;175;We rented this castle for a birthday, and we were delighted! The place is truly magical, and very well kept. The caretakers were very kind and attentive, they did everything to make sure we had a pleasant weekend!;9
1248;155;2022-06-10;176;Amazing place! Amazing team!;10
1249;156;2022-07-30;177;It's all about the view, from the moment you walk in, then later it changes colour as the sun drops, only to blow you away again in the morning. Metro at your doorstep and walking distance of so much. The apartment was the standout highlight of our trip.;10
1250;156;2022-08-10;178;Francesco was so gracious and hospitable I couldn’t have asked for more in a place or host!;10
1251;156;2022-08-15;179;We absolutely loved this location! The view speaks for itself, and we were in walking distance to everything. Francesco was extremely flexible with our check in and check out, which we appreciated. Will stay again for sure.;9
1252;156;2022-08-22;180;The location was enough to give this place a high rating. Francesco was attentive and the communication was the best. He arranged our transportation from the airport to the apartment and provided recommendations. Super hospitable and he made our first night really smooth with the assistance in coordinating our arrival to avoid additional planning. My husband and I really enjoyed the apartment. It was roomy and just as advertised.;10
1253;156;2022-09-03;181;Amazing view and a fabulous host! Great communication, fantastic apartment a 30 min or less walk from every major site in Rome.;9
1254;156;2022-09-17;182;We had a great stay, the view and jacuzzi are spectacular! Mirko let us check in early in another room so that we could freshen up while we were waiting for ours to be available. Francesco was very communicative and helpful.;10
1255;156;2022-09-22;183;Perfect location and great host. Would stay again!;10
1256;156;2022-09-26;184;"beautiful apartment with stunning views of the colosseum. A
small romantic evening with a jaccuzi in the room.
Thank you for this evening and see you soon.";10
1257;157;2022-08-15;185;Wonderful host and pleasant to work with. He welcomed us with food, wine and goodies. Also he was a big help to arrange our ride back to the airport.;10
1258;157;2022-08-22;186;Superb host, superb location, superb place. Although tucked away in a quiet neighbourhood, it was easy to find, thanks mainly to the information provided by our host. As mentioned in previous reviews, having the fridge stocked was a great touch and the place itself was spotlessly clean and very well-equipped. We'd definitely look at booking again should we return to Milan.;9
1259;157;2022-09-03;187;For all of those that would like to stay in Milan. This place was excellent. The host is amazing, probably the best.;10
1260;157;2022-09-17;188;The listing is described accurately, and the host was very attentive to our needs. I would definitely recommend;9
1261;157;2022-09-22;189;Great place. Super clean. Fully stocked with snacks/drinks. Location very central to activities and public transportation. And an unbelievable, gracious and kind host that was there for anything needed. The Sullivan Family, Acworth, GA, USA;10
1262;157;2022-09-26;190;The host is very service oriented! Even a filled fridge for us - great thank you! The apartment has a great location, is very nicely furnished and super renovated. Highly recommended!;10
1263;158;2021-08-04;191;Beautiful and big Apartment. Antoine was always available and responded quickly. We were even able to check in earlier. Highly recommended. We'd love to come back;10
1264;158;2022-06-27;192;"Antoine is a great host. He answered all the queries within few minutes. He was also very helpful.

The place is less than 5 minutes walk to Eiffel Tower. The house is renovated and has good amenities.

I would recommend everyone to choose this place.";9

1268;159;2022-04-18;196;This place was like a beautiful woman—incredible attention to detail and everything in exactly the appropriate place… well designed, decorated and attended to. I was very fortunate to have been able to stay in such an amazing place for such a great value!;10
1269;159;2022-06-19;197;Amazing vibe within the apartment and located in a fantastic location. Couldn’t have asked for a better stay!;9
1270;159;2022-08-22;198;I stayed in thisapartment with my family and our small dog: upon arrival we found a pleasant surprise for him, that is, a kit of bowls, traverses and bags for the collection of needs! The house is well equipped with everything you need for your stay. The location is absolutely strategic!!! All clean and tastefully decorated! Another advantage is the shower, which is comfortable and has a nice water jet! Strong phone (which you rarely find);10
1271;159;2022-10-26;199;Welcoming,hospitable, impeccable,the three rules of a perfect stay, which Annalisa and her accommodation reflect in full. Very central location, I highly recommend it:);10

Ranti was extremely responsive and really flexible.
Thank you for a great stay.";9
1274;160;2022-08-15;202;"Fabulous location for a great value. We stayed here and explored London during our 24 hour layover.

I would only recommend this place if you’re planning to be out all day and if you only need a spot to keep your bags and to sleep.";7
1275;160;2022-08-22;203;So friendly and lovely place to stay! Close to the St James Park station so we could get everywhere around London. Very cozy and a nice place to sleep and dry off after a rainy day. Felt very safe and good here!;9
1276;161;2022-08-10;204;Tanya’s place is great for those looking for a place near tourists attractions. Very private location only downside is a shared toilet with the other upstairs unit.;10
1277;161;2022-08-15;205;"I would definitely recommend this place to friends who want to stay in the financial district.

Tanya portrayed the place very well. The location is very conveniently close to the piers, subway, and various food spots.

The check-in process was easy.
We were happy with the loft and everything included in it.";10
1278;161;2022-08-22;206;"Great location with lots a good local bars, cafés and restaurants. The place itself was comfortable though smaller than expected. Three beds were mentioned in the description, but there were really only two. There was also mention of a ""dish washer"" which was really just a bathroom sink. I would have been fine without one, but it's a bit misleading to say there is one when there is not. Overall it was a decent spot to stay at. The host was really nice and was quick to respond to messages.";9
1279;161;2022-09-03;207;Very responsive!!! Such a good price to be in the middle of it all. Thank you!;10

1281;161;2022-09-22;209;"Great place in the heart of NY Downtown!!
Just a quick walk from the Wall Street and 9/11 memorial this spacious apartment is perfect for tourists. We really enjoyed the time in NYC and the stay at Tanya’s place.

The flexibility (e.g. checkout time and luggage lock in) and quick response time are HUGE plus points with this apartment!";10
1282;162;2022-07-21;210;Ninja house was just incredible and was such a fun place to stay! The attention to detail was insane! It had everything we needed and I only wish we could have spent more time there .Jack was so generous with his time and told us the best places to go and eat-he also took us to the airport bus station and helped us. Naomi was super responsive. I highly recommend this place.;10
1283;162;2022-08-15;211; would recommend this property to anyone traveling to Osaka. It was in a great location and Naomi and Jack were amazing to work with. Jack met us at the station and drove us to the property, along with showing us the ins and outs of the details of our stay. The details were wonderful, little ninjas and hidden places that you get to uncover throughout your stay. This would be the ultimate place for a family with younger kids.;10
1284;162;2022-09-25;212;We had a great time at Naomi's place. The kids loved the Ninja house and its central location made it easy for us to walk and bike to places.;9
1285;162;2022-10-01;213;Best house around Osaka, unique design house and a lots of things to do there. And at afternoon we use bicycle to looks around, if you want to dotonburi just walk 5-10 minutes. Overall we enjoy stay at ninja house. Will be coming again if we visit Osaka again, see you next time Naomi;10
1286;162;2022-10-19;214;Fun place to stay and a very cool concept;10
1287;162;2022-12-05;215;"Amazing themed accomodation in a great location - right next to Dotonburi!

Special thanks needs to be given to the host and her employees, they were extremely prompt and responsive.

Next time I am in Osaka, I would easily choose to stay at Ninja House again!";10
1288;163;2022-06-15;216;We had the most wonderful time at Haidi's apartment. The location is perfect, the listing is accurate and had all the amenities we needed (and more). The place was very clean and Haidi is a very responsive host with lots of great recommendations. We'd definitely like to come back!;10
1289;163;2022-07-25;217;Haidi was So friendly and extremely helpful. I had some issuers and she came In person to discuss and sort immediately she was also so helpful when I had an issue and offered to help in any way. The apartment could not be better it’s tasteful, really clean and with the most informal e beds you can imagine. She is someone who takes great pride in her city and work. As one of the reviews in her comment go on said 10 out if 10;9
1290;163;2022-08-01;218;Wonderful place, great location, walkable to most of POI in Athens. Beautiful apartment!;10
1291;163;2022-09-19;219;Haidi is a great host! Lots of great recommendations and the place is immaculately clean and you can't beat the location and view;10
1292;163;2022-11-05;220;Absolutely stunning home with picture perfect views. The home was clean and comfortable during our stay. Communication throughout the whole process was great and easy to understand. Well situated in the heart of Athens with everything you need at your disposal. Highly recommend and would stay hear again.;10
1293;164;2022-07-21;221;"GREAT place to stay. Responsive host.
Clean, views, cozy and presentable place. It’s in the heart of everything. Within walking distance.
Parking is a great plus!";10

1297;165;2021-06-06;225;"I cannot recommend this enough - one of the best stays we’ve ever had. Since the beginning, the host was super responsive, helpful and shared very clear instructions.
The pictures didn’t do the flat justice: it’s even more stunning in person. The location is also super convenient. If you want an unforgettable stay in Dubai downtown, this is your place!
Thanks for everything.";10
1298;165;2022-07-21;226;Great apartment. Everything is super. We hope to return;10
1299;165;2022-08-10;227;Excellent stay - will visit again for sure;10

Nice room, has everything you need.";9

1302;166;2022-08-15;230;"You will be forgiven for thinking Richard’s place is all about the view because that is what hits you as you open the door and take in your surroundings.

However that detracts from the overall experience of the accommodation, this has to be one of the best equipped places we have stayed in. Every possible eventuality is catered for, plenty of quality crockery, cutlery and amenities.

The furnishings are good quality and the bed more than comfortable.

Richard gave us the most important advice which we followed with gusto and that was to enjoy drinks on the balcony !";10
1303;166;2022-09-25;231;"Absolutely stunning would highly recommend views are amazing
Richard was a great host
Definitely will return";9
1304;166;2022-10-01;232;"First, I was a bit skeptical. Mainly, because it is on the other side of the bridge, it seemed to be not that ""close"" to the city center. However, the ferry is super convenient, and a subway is not that far away. The only drawback is a lack of air conditioning; the rest is just excellent. So I recommend going to the BWS (just a few minutes away), grabbing some good bottles of Australian red wine, and then enjoying the stunning view with your beloved ones on the balcony.";10
1305;166;2022-10-19;233;"This was a return visit for us and once again we were blown away with the view. It really is even better in reality. Richard is such a good host and is always very responsive and goes above and beyond when it comes to early/late check-in which is a huge help for us personally. It’s in a great area and is easily accessible for walking to restaurants & cafes and you can walk across into the city via the bridge within 45 mins to an hour quite easily.
We wouldn’t want to stay anywhere else if we ever get to go to Sydney again.";9
1306;166;2022-12-05;234;Richard’s place was just a described. Very clean, comfortable and amazing views! If you are looking for great views of the Opera House and Sydney Harbor this is the place for you. Also, easy access by nearby ferry to the city.;9
1307;167;2022-07-21;235;If you looking for the perfect host and a beautiful apartment in the most majestic setting in Barcelona stop scrolling. Enric’s apartment is modern with a thought out designer influence and spotlessly clean. Enric is the prefect host that is truly knowledgeable of all that Barcelona has to offer from must see locations to perfectly selected dining experiences. On arrival Enric makes sure you are welcomed with a fridge filled with fruit, various drink options and Spanish treats and to top of a perfect memory a dream come true for my family tickets to a Barcelona football match. 10/10 and more thank you for your incredible hospitality Enric.;10
1308;167;2022-08-15;236;Enric is the best!!! He gave us tips, provided us grocery that some airbnbs can’t provide. The place is clean and the perfect location for tourists! Thank you Enric! Will come back again soon :-);9
1309;167;2022-09-25;237;Magnificent. The location is amazing. You really are a few feet away from the Sagrada Familia. The apartment is top notch. Spotlessly clean, comfortable, fully stocked refrigerator, and feet away from a metro stop. Enric is a spectacular host. He is not only responsive but his suggestions (all of which were great) could keep you busy for weeks.;10
1310;167;2022-10-01;238;This is a super place with a super host. The setting couldn't be better (the photos are accurate) and Enric did everything he could to make our stay memorable. We appreciated how well stocked the kitchen was. Would love to stay here again some day.;10
1311;167;2022-10-19;239;Worth the price. Enric the host makes you want to return to Barcelona & stay at his place to explore more. He is honestly a beyond súper host. His hospitality, his recommendations and his flexibility makes for such a pleasant way to vacation & stay as it should be. Muchas Gracias Enric. We shall return, & we will definitely continue to recommend this unit & Enric. 🤩;10
1312;168;2022-07-21;240;Fantastic host! Very friendly and eager to ensure our visit was enjoyable.;10
1313;168;2022-08-10;241;"ery kind and gracious host. She did our laundry and we enjoyed the breakfast she prepared for us. She made us feel right at home.

The suite was very traditional, clean, and cute. Had everything we needed. Enjoyed using the bikes to ride around the city for a day. We would definitely stay again and recommend :)";10
1314;168;2022-08-22;242;We absolutely love this perfect place in Kyoto! The ryokan was a highlight of our Kyoto trip and it was amazing once in a lifetime experience. The breakfast was amazing!!!! And the hostess was fabulous! She didn’t speak English too well, but she could still communicate exceptionally well and her great energy made our day. I highly highly recommend! My girlfriend and I already are thinking of coming back to Kyoto just so we can stay here again! Also the use of the bikes allowed us to explore Kyoto in a fun and different way. Everything was very thoughtful and prepared! Loved it;9
1315;168;2022-09-03;243;Staying next to a temple is a unique experience. The rooms are spacious. There were no problems in communication (English) before and during the stay. Yoshino-san lives next door and does everything she can to support the customer.;10
1316;169;2022-05-11;244;This is an extraordinary and beautiful restored house, we wish we could have stayed longer. It is located in a quiet part of the lovely town of Takayama but it is only a short walk from the old town, morning market and the Higashiyama walking course. The hosts were very helpful and very flexible in accommodating our plans. Car parking is very convenient.;10
1317;169;2022-05-31;245;"The home is spectacular. Like living in a piece of Japanese history.
The location is perfect — a maximum 20 minute walk to anywhere you want to be through the most gorgeous neighborhoods of antique homes.
The host is exceptionally helpful! Sanae helped with every aspect of our Kanazawa experience — restaurant recommendations, suggestions of places to explore, and even ordering us a taxi to take us to the train when we departed (which can be challenging since we don’t speak Japanese).
We couldn’t have imagined a more wonderful stay and experience.";9
1318;169;2022-06-27;246;Fantastic! I highly recommend!;10
1319;169;2022-07-09;247;"the place is amazing beautiful
thank you for everything, definitely will come again";9
1320;169;2022-08-20;248;Beautiful courtyard. Awesome Ryokan style living. We wake up to a beautiful autumn fall garden that has many colour leaves. The place is big and comfortable. It feels cold at first, but once we manage to figure out how to work the heaters around, it was fine. The place is very near the action. Just walk down a little way, and the morning market is just there. You can walk through the takayama sites with ease. I had a 4 year old with me, he could manage the walks. We took the strollers at times too. Host is also very responsive and helpful in providing me tips on where to buy stuff I want and also recommended awesome food places. There is a Kyoyo restaurant just maybe 5 mins walk, it has an awesome selection of local food at very affordable prices.;10
1321;170;2022-07-21;249;Naniwa Ryokan is a great place to stay if you like delicious Japanese food. It is clean and close to Oninoshitaburui and other spots in Okuizumo. The communication for the reservation was easy, but once you are at the ryokan it helps to speak some Japanese. We enjoyed our stay.;10
1322;170;2022-08-15;250;Comfortable;8
1323;170;2022-09-25;251;First time in Okuzumo.I was impressed and visited, but it was an unexpected charm and more than I expected.Thank you very much;9
1324;170;2022-10-01;252;Good access with a location in front of the station.;10
1325;170;2022-10-23;253;The building itself feels old, but the toilet and bath were renovated and I had a comfortable stay.;9
1326;171;2022-06-25;254;"It is a nice inn that communicates politely to each person and makes it easy to spend time!
I stayed for consecutive nights, but please think about food every day so I don't get tired (it's very delicious and healthy!!)They were supportive and stress-free when we went on our trip!";10
1327;171;2022-07-21;255;"It was a short stay, but we were very slow.
I liked the good smell of medicinal water and herbal water in the public bath.There was an extra charge, but the breakfast was really delicious.The thoughtful hospitality of the staff is also very wonderful, and it is an inn that I would like to stay again.";9
1328;171;2022-08-15;256;"I was able to relax with my friends in a very clean inn.
Thank you very much.";9
1329;171;2022-09-25;257;The staff was also very polite, and I was able to relax in a calm space.You can feel the four seasons from the window of the room. I want to use it again!;9
1330;171;2022-10-01;258;"We had a very pleasant time with the staff smiling and were able to welcome us.The room was clean and clean, and we slept well.
Thank you!";9
1331;172;2022-08-15;259;This stay exceeded our expectations in every way. Hideyuki, Yuri and their beautiful girls are gracious hosts who were so generous in teaching us about Akita culture and customs. The food was wonderful, the futon were warm, and the company was delightful. The house is gorgeous, remodelled in recent years to preserve the integrity of the original structure. We highly recommend a stay here!;10
1332;172;2022-09-25;260;Amazing and cozy house. Hideyuki was very nice and friendly. We talked a lot avout the local traditional hunting in Akita. I definitely would like to go hunting with him next time.;10
1333;172;2022-10-01;261;This was a very nice place for escaping tourists, the hosts are a really sweet family and knowing them was fun. Many nature around to explore.;9
1334;172;2022-10-19;262;The guesthouse was such a unique experience and the host made sure we were warm on an exceptionally cold summer night. The kiritampo is a must-try!;10
1335;172;2022-12-05;263;This is a unique place with amazing atmosphere. This is a place that you can really fill the non touristic japan, with one of the best hospitality and attitude. Very close to many nature excursions and very convenient for Akita festival if you got car;9
1336;173;2022-05-11;264;Staying here felt like a dream. Staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. The perfect place to get some peace and calm 💕;10
1337;173;2022-05-31;265;Lovely cozy stay at and original Japanese home. A bit noisy but everything was great.;10
1338;173;2022-06-27;266;Such a lovely place.;9
1339;173;2022-07-09;267;The guest-house was very reminiscent of the Makanai show on Netflix, which i loved! The architecture, the interiors, the small garden at the back, even the sounds made by the sliding doors, etc, true to a Kyoto machiya style house built before the 1950s. The host, Mari, was warm and fun and made my stay very comfortable and relaxing. Do not miss out on the breakfast - the onigiri and the soup was fantastic;10
1340;173;2022-08-20;268;Absolutely beautiful interior and interior garden. Our room had a private garden view. I couldn't afford to stay at a ryokan so I chose this place. It was a great decision in the end. The breakfast was cute and delicious. I really nice Japanese homely experience.;9
1341;174;2022-08-10;269;I have absolutely no complaints other than one minor detail that I know everyone will soon experience, which was the unavoidable noise from the train station behind the house and metal factory that was attached to the home on the first floor. Exactly what you expect in the pictures local to almost everything you need, walking to the station was only seven minutes. Very grateful I found this place, would recommend to everyone. Just make sure to bring earplugs or wake up early. The hosts where extremely patient even as we got lost on the train seven times, making many mistakes getting on the wrong trains for two hours. They still were very patient trying to help us find them. The most professional, and comfortable Airbnb experience I’ve had in a foreign country.;10
1342;174;2022-08-22;270;Great host. Even picked us up from the metro station. Apartment has view over Mt. Fuji if.;9
1343;174;2022-09-03;271;Great place!!;9
1344;174;2022-10-11;272;We enjoyed the space & easy walking distance to the train station. There are some steps to go up, but that didn't bother us. I enjoyed walking around the area seeing local shrines, markets, & everday life.;10
1345;175;2022-08-15;273;Amazing and inspiring couple! So helpful and kind! Good vibes!;10
1346;175;2022-09-25;274;"A special and wonderful stay. This older-style house is tucked away against a hillside, seemingly miles from anywhere, but is also only minutes by car to most places you'd want to go. the house is pretty and comfortable in an authentically rustic way. It was cold at night but there were plenty of blankets and heaters.

We asked for dinner on the first night, which was prepared very nicely and made for a relaxing evening. there are also plenty of places to eat if you have a car, so don't feel that you are stuck.

A great chance to experience something unique and different in the Japanese countryside.";9
1347;175;2022-10-01;275;"As soon as I got there I knew I should have booked for longer. The house and surroundings were amazing. The hosts were very friendly and helpful.
If you're traveling around the town I highly recommend getting taxi vouchers from the tourist information center. It's a good deal. Sights to see in the area other than nature is the large amount of shrines, and of course the knife village.";9
1348;176;2022-07-21;276;Mr. Kiku's place is cozy and the surrounding is quiet and relaxing! The Japanese breakfast and dinner provided by Mr. Kiku are delicious, especially since the food was served in a warm and beautifully decorated dining room. Even though Mr. Kiku can't speak fluent English but he tried his best to help us and even gave us a ride to Geibikei for the boat ride. So language is definitely not a problem here and Mr.Kiku will try his best to help in all ways!;10
1349;176;2022-08-15;277;Kiku-san was prompt, informative and very helpful. His service was relaxed but attentive. The accommodation was excellent! You get to experience the Japanese style house with Engawa;10
1350;176;2022-09-25;278;Very nice place to stay offering true Japanese experience. Great hospitality.;9
1351;177;2022-08-15;279;We had a lovely stay. Would recommend.;10
1352;177;2022-09-25;280;A great hanok in an excellent location, very traditional but still situated right on the main tourist street in Gyeongju. A very peaceful and beautiful place to stay!;9
1353;177;2022-10-01;281;This place is excellent for all trying to experience a traditional hanok stay, the place holds a beautiful secret garden hidden away by a high wall and gate. The location is next to the main tourist area so the location is perfect with quick access to all the main tourist sites. The host is excellent and very kind, who is more than willing to help you out if you need. I recommend this for everyone who is planning a trip to Gyeongju!;8
1354;177;2022-10-19;282;10 Stars! ^^;10
1355;178;2022-08-15;283;"Possibly the best location you can stay at.
Relatively easy to get to, beautiful and outgoing hosts, and lots to do and see!
10/10. 🙌🏼";10
1356;178;2022-09-25;284;Very convenient place slosed to Snow monkey Park and Shigakogen Ski resorts.;9
1357;178;2022-10-01;285;It is the entrance to Shibuya Onsen, so it was good for sightseeing outside the hot spring;10
1358;178;2022-10-19;286;"This inn can easily accommodate solo travelers.
It is an old ryokan. However, the front desk and shared areas have new systems that are stylish and easy to spend time in.The food is also delicious. I think there is a Jivier for dinner, so I would like to try it next time. You can also lend me the keys for the 9 yu tour for free, and you can enjoy it with a sushi and a yukata. You can also enjoy the stamplarry by buying a hand wipe for 9 hot water tour.
It is a great ryokan with a mix of old and new. This price is great for tourist destinations.";9
1359;179;2022-07-21;287;Zen vague is a very interesting place, just as suggested by it name. If you would like to experience the Zen and vagueness, this is probably a very good place to be. I like it though I was confused y several points. But it is a nice way to experience Zen vaguely!;10
1360;179;2022-08-15;288;It was peaceful during my one night stay. Would return again for a longer stay!;9
1361;179;2022-09-25;289;Very nice area and house to relax.;9
1362;180;2022-06-27;290;Everything was perfect, wonderful location;10
1363;180;2022-07-09;291;A wonderful place to celebrate holidays. Great for 2 people. New, super neat and clean. Beautiful swimming pool plenty of opportunity to sunbathe and enjoy the beautiful views. Visited from here nice villages , beach, etc. Super friendly residents and very welcoming. Upon arrival, all kinds of delicacies and drinks were ready for us. The house is located on a somewhat busier road, you can hear the traffic. No dishwasher is available for us, but we missed it.;10
1364;180;2022-08-20;292;Wonderful villa!! I've never enjoyed such a stay. Beautiful view and flawless host, nice suggestions. I've taken beautiful trips around.;9

1366;181;2022-08-15;294;Emanuele was great, perfect host. Would definitely recommend;10
1367;182;2022-07-16;295;Absolutely incredible! STUNNING views! Davide was an excellent host, I will come back for sure;10
1368;182;2022-08-13;296;Just beautiful! Place is very clean, beautiful views and just overall gorgeous. The hosts are wonderful and communicate to make sure you’re good and have everything you need for a wonderful stay. Highly recommend, make sure you’re in good shape, a lot of walking and stairs, but so worth it :).;10
1369;183;2022-07-21;297;This was our favorite stay on the almafi coast. Beautiful, peaceful, and clean stay close enough to local restaurants and grocery store. We hope to return one day!;9
1370;183;2022-08-10;298;"Our stay was amazing! Watching the sunrise every morning, a quick refreshing jump to the pool, drinking your coffee in tranquility with the view all in blue and walking up&down the stairs everywhere even to climb to the path of the gods… We wish to stay longer!
I would say the house and everything it provides to you is much more than explained in the ad. You have to experience and re-experience it! Big thanks to host to make this experience smooth.";10
1371;183;2022-08-22;299;Amazing stay! Not only were the accommodations perfect but loved the town of Praiano. It was a nice a quiet stay after a busy holiday. The photos don’t do it justice and it looks prettier in person. The view was our favorite and just enjoyed as much time out there as possible. Would love to come back.;10
1372;184;2022-07-21;300;"After a 30 day stay at Villa Aristide I can tell you -
This is the perfect spot to enjoy the Amalfi Coast. The location of Praiano is out of the tourist area but close enough to visit those areas as you wish.
Praiano is full of wonderful restaurants and hotels. The people are friendly and the service level is high.

When choosing Praiano- be aware of the amount of steps and steep incline hills to navigate around as is with all the billiard around the coast.";10
1373;184;2022-08-15;301;Highly recommend! The property is beautiful with amazing views from the roof and garden. Location is central, easy walk to market and restaurants in Praiano, and to the Path of the Gods hike. Eva was such a warm and friendly host. Exceeded our expectations and would definitely come back to stay here again!;10
1374;184;2022-09-25;302;Villa Aristide is incredible!!! We had such a beautiful stay. Absolutely gorgeous views! Location was perfect- just between Positano & Amalfi. There’s plenty of space and balconies and a very refreshing pool. Communication was easy. Highly recommend.;9
1375;185;2022-07-16;303;"A beautiful place to stay, where we felt comfortable and relaxed. The views cannot be beaten. Ravello has the most wonderful restaurants and there is plenty to see locally or in nearby towns.

Would highly recommend.";10
1376;185;2022-08-22;304;"The outdoor area is as stunning as in the pictures; amazing views and the landscaping is beautifully designed and maintained. The kitchen is great as is the bathroom, the bedroom is indeed small but it does have a closet. The outdoor space would accommodate a group but the indoor space is definitely for a couple, maybe one child if you're a family. They had welcome items in the fridge when we arrived which was a lovely touch. All that being said, and to be fair, it is advertised in the listing, there are far too many rules for me to have felt relaxed. There are parameters on when you arrive, you need to stay on top of the trash collection schedule, you need to haul it out yourself and leave everything tip top. If you are a person that is comfortable with lots of rules don't hesitate, it is a beautiful space but if too many parameters makes you feel anxious and unrelaxed (most especially on vacation), I don't recommend it.";6
1377;185;2022-09-03;305;Great place to stay for our honeymoon on the Amalfi coast! Would only recommend for people looking for a bit of seclusion and okay with stairs, but for us, it was perfect!;9
1378;185;2022-09-17;306;This place is a gem! It really is a quiet and beautiful oasis for anyone looking to relax. The view is incredible, and the nearby town is so charming. As other reviewers have mentioned, be prepared for many stairs. You will need to hike up to Ravello town square for everything (groceries, wine, etc. etc.) so keep that in mind :) We hope to stay again in the future!;10
1379;186;2022-06-27;307;Great place if you are looking for a quiet spot away from crowds or other people. However, the place needs a bit of TLC/updating. All sun loungers by the pool broken and grounds/garden are not well maintained. Swimming pool wasn't working but host did inform us beforehand. We never met the hosts during our 4 night stay which is fine if that is what you are looking for.;10
1380;186;2022-07-21;308;Confirm pool is operational before stay. If driving to home small car is recommended and the drive way off main road is greater than 90 degree turn coming from the north. The stone house driveway(#263) is shared by another home which is further up the driveway (#265) and that owner has no tolerance for lost Airbnb renters.;8
1381;186;2022-08-15;309;clean, nice, lovely place and a nice swimmingpool;10
1382;186;2022-09-25;310;The stone house was lovely! It served as a good base for us to explore Tuscany. We enjoyed the views and the space very much!;9
1383;187;2022-07-16;311;"You’ll want to stay for longer than three days to enjoy this beautiful place.
Highly recommend having a car as it’s very hard to reach without one.
Also recommend taking some of your own food & drinks as there are cooking facilities available on site.
An incredible place you won’t want to leave!";10
1384;187;2022-08-22;312;Fantastic property, amazing views, amazing food, lovely people and a very enjoyable experience overall!! Be prepared for a lot of walking around the property (if you don’t have a car) as the buildings are a bit spread out. It’s never really too far and is a fantastic opportunity to enjoy the property and views as you walk around but can be a bit muddy and treacherous at times so be sure to bring proper shoes.;9
1385;188;2022-06-27;313;"Beautiful house in best location. Many different beaches close to the house which everyone is absolutely amazing. Manuela is the best host and always available for some help or organising nice trips.
We had an amazing time with the whole familiy. (8 adults, 2 kids)
The service was so good.
One of the best holidays we ever had. For sure we go again soon.";10
1386;188;2022-07-09;314;Manuela and the villa were absolutely stunning. A pure luxe retreat in nature. Absolutely breathtaking every part of the way. The pool.. the touches and linens.. the outdoor area and the cozy space. It was absolutely lovely.;9
1387;188;2022-08-20;315;Manuela is a very attentive host. She gave us numerous tips on restaurants and excursions, and even made the bookings for us. She is always very responsive (replies within 1 hour) and the minor issues we had, were fixed immediately. Also, when my husband had an injury, Manuela -who is a vet- kept in touch with him to make sure he got the right treatment.;9
1388;189;2022-07-21;316;Beautiful house with everything you need. Went with the Company för 3 nights and we could not Think of a better place. The host was very easy to get in Contact with if we had any questions. A perfect stay!;10
1389;189;2022-08-15;317;"Podere Torricella is just as an amazing place live as it is on pictures. We celebrated birthday there with 14 people. Mario helped us with all the programmes, activities, catering and basic things. We had an italian dinner and a pizzanight there.
The landscapes are soothing countryside scenes, and there is a lot of beautiful areas and nice activity possibilities in 30 to 60 min driveaway from the villa.
I highly recommend this villa for bigger groups.";9

1392;191;2022-07-21;320;The place looks 100% like it does in the photos it should be clarified. It is not a hot tub, but rather a heated pool, which was also fabulous to have. The place was very clean and the kitchen well stocked I would absolutely recommend it and stay there again.;10

1397;193;2022-07-21;325;Hosts are awesome. They went out of their way to find reservations at a restaurant on a Saturday which was much appreciated. The view from the room was fantastic.;10
1398;193;2022-08-22;326;Stunning house & perfect view of Rome sunsets. Lovely people, very friendly & helpful. We recommend visiting local area including Poli - incredible countryside. Maximum score for our stay!;10
1399;193;2022-09-12;327;UNBELIEVABLE views. The property is amazing, the owners are so sweet, and even the drive there was incredible. Stunning and surreal. Very clean and private. Just make sure you know EXACTLY where you’re going before you set out to arrive. We did not have an exact address to plug into GPS, we were just taken to a random point on that mountain road, and when we realized it we were out of cell service. Thankfully everyone I’ve met in Italy has been extremely gracious and helpful and someone at a nearby restaurant helped us find the property. It may have been my own error, so really nothing bad to say at all :);9
